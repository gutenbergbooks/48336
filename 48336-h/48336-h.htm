<h2>NOTE.</h2>


<p>There were no more vivid episodes in the colonization
of the New World than those resulting from
the attempts of the French people to gain a permanent
foothold on our shores. This fact has long
been recognized by sober historians as well as
by the writers of fiction, for all the fascination of
romance holds over the whole field of inquiry.</p>

<p>The most thrilling chapter in all this history,
strangely neglected or overlooked by the romantic
writers, is that of the struggle between the Spanish
and French colonists for dominion over our own
land of Florida. To me, whose profession it is to
see pictures in the words of other men and to produce
them, this historic page has appealed very
strongly as the proper setting for a human drama—an
inviting canvas upon which the imagination
may paint a moving picture of the emotions, desires
and passions—the loves and hates—of men and
women like ourselves—against the somber and sometimes
lurid background of historic fact.</p>

<p>I have tried, so far as I have used history, to
be scrupulously exact. I have carefully read the
original or authorized editions of the writings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
Hakluyt, Réné de Laudonnière, and a number of
others; but there is little to be found in them
which will not also be found much more vividly
depicted in the writings of Mr. Francis Parkman.
Some of the names will be recognized. Jean Ribault,
Laudonnière, Menendez, the Indians Satouriona,
Olotoraca and Emola, and others, were all real men.
As for those others who are of the imagination—as
for Mademoiselle and those who searched for her, it
is to be hoped that they will not be found at odds
with the events and scenes in which they are placed.
These things, or others like them, must have been,
for the writer of historic fiction may rely on the fact
that human nature remains much the same, no matter
how great the lapse of years.</p>

<p class="noi title">IN SEARCH OF MADEMOISELLE.</p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />
<small>OF MY MEETING WITH MASTER HOOPER.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">It has ever been my notion that apology is designed
to conceal a purpose rather than to
express it; that excuse is not contrition but only
self-esteem. Therefore it seems ill-fitting to begin
my narration thus, especially as there are many Spaniards
who will say that I lie in all that I have written.
But this will matter little to me, for I have
had good confirmation in the writings of their own
priests and chroniclers. Before many years are
gone, I will rest peaceful in the churchyard at
Tavistock and the ranting of any person, of whatever
creed will avail little to disturb my bones. I
shall die believing in God Almighty; that is enough
for me.</p>

<p>These blind fanatics think themselves privileged
to commit any crime in His name. They speak of
God as though they owned Him; as though none
other were in a position even to think of Him with any
understanding. But indeed there is little to choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
between the madmen of any races. Twenty years
have barely passed since Thomas Cobham sewed
eight and forty Spaniards in their own mainsail and
cast them overboard. Not long agone certain English
soldiers in Mexico filled a Jesuit priest with
gunpowder, blowing him to pieces.</p>

<p>I do not attempt to justify my part in the happenings
of which I am to write, and the terrible
retribution brought upon the Spaniards. I can
only say that my own intimate life and love were
so twined into these events that I followed where
my wild heart led, as one distraught. It is enough
that I loved—and now love—Diane better than
woman was ever loved, and that I hated Diego
with a hate which has outlived death itself.</p>

<p>Being but a blunt mariner and God-fearing man,
with a knowledge of the elements rather than any
great learning of the quiet arts, the description of
these happenings lacks the readiness of the skilled
writer, from whose quill new quips and phrases
easily pass. Yet, what I, Sydney Killigrew, am to
write has virtue in its reality; and its strangeness
may even exceed those tales written by the sprightly
wits of London, whom I am told it is the fashion
of Her Majesty to gather about her.</p>

<p>For although a true report of the people of Florida
has been made by Admiral Jean Ribault, the
story of the great deception practised upon him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that Spaniard, Menendez de Avilés is now for the
first time to be truly written by one who was with the
Frenchmen at that time. And in view of the English
settlements which may shortly be made by Her
Majesty to the northward, it seems proper and
valuable that this should be written.</p>

<p>The more do I deem this my duty when I consider
the cruel wars which men have fought for the modes
by which the good God may be worshiped. Reformist,
New Thinker, or whatever I may be, these
events have only convinced me of the truth of the
saying of my father, “Live thy <em>life</em> right, my young
mariner, and thy mode of faith will be forgiven.”
That great, good father—naval commander of his
king, Councilor of the Realm, noble in life as in
lineage—upon whose talents and genius every half-hearted
earl in the kingdom had laid a claim! For
whatever he may have lacked in wisdom for the betterment
of his own estate in the world, he had ever
the wit to advise others to their great good fortune
and happiness.</p>

<p>As I stood against a pile on the great dock at
Plymouth and looked across the fine harbor through
the network of rigging, I thought of the days of
the Great Henry when good ships well manned and
victualed, and commanded by men of valor and
ingenuity, were ready at all hours to uphold the
dignity of their king upon the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Now all was changed. The mighty fleets that
lay off in Plymouth Sound in Henry’s day, had
rotted in anchorage and not a halliard had been
rove on a ship of the line for fifteen years. Discipline
on royal ships was a matter of no account,
for no man knew what change the week to come
might work in his command. Even now the coasts
of England lay open to the attack of any foreign
ships that might choose to run in and fire the
broadsides of their great new pieces of ordnance.
Here in Plymouth harbor lay but four revenue
ships of one hundred tons, and three converted
merchant brigs which had been lightly armed. At
London there were perhaps as many more, and
these were all,—all that great fair England had in
her harbors to ward off danger from the Spaniards,
ever ready and watchful across the channel! There
was naught for a seaman to do; and if a Bible or
prayer-book chanced to be found on board any ship
in Papist waters, she would be confiscate forthwith
and her company of seamen would be carried to the
prisons of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>A voyage in the narrow seas, from which I had
returned but a few days before, more than anything
else had given me the desire to see service with
some foreign nation where a stout arm had more
value than a heart set on “paternosters” or psalm
books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>In truth, though this trouble was partly of my
own making, I had had enough of the merchant
service. To go back to Tavistock was not to my
liking; for though I had a taste for peace among
men I had no stomach for a life of idleness. I had
been bred by my father to the sights and smells of
the sea, the voice of which was more grateful to my
ears than the sounds of the wood-birds which had
ever seemed to me mere shrill and noisy pipings.
And though in no manner a brawler, a life of enterprise
suited me mightily.</p>

<p>As I labored in this quandary, a hand was laid
upon my shoulder and a rough voice at my side said
heartily, “Why,—is not this Sydney Killigrew of
Tavistock?” And turning I saw Master David
Hooper, my father’s friend, who went as Master
Commander in the last cruise of the <i>Great
Harry</i>.</p>

<p>“None other, Captain Hooper!” said I, grasping
with great joy his hairy fist. He held me off at
arm’s length and looked at me carefully, noting my
great stature with evident enjoyment.</p>

<p>“The very image of thy father—though, by my
faith, thou’rt built upon a more sumptuous scale.
But, lad, what’s wrong? You’ve the air of a farmer’s
boy two days from land.”</p>

<p>And with that, after other exchanges of compliments,
I told him how the world had gone with me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
how our estates had fallen from bad to worse and
how little chance there seemed of pursuing the calling
upon the ocean I loved and wished for. He
heard me through, tapping the while thoughtfully
with his fingers upon the pier head.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he at length, “let us go to some
place where we can discuss thy affairs at leisure.”</p>

<p>And he led the way from the dock up the street
to the Pelican Inn, where seafaring men such as
ourselves were wont to go for a pot or so of Master
Martin Cockrem’s own brewing. Once seated there
in the quiet window seat overlooking the Sound, he
questioned me closely as to my disposition in religious
and political affairs. Then finding that I was
not averse to taking up a true life of adventure upon
the sea, he unburdened himself of his own plans for
the future.</p>

<p>“You know, lad, of the state of the Royal Navy.
Nothing I can say will make you feel that the merchant
service is secure from injury at foreign hands.
<i>Great Harry</i>, the wonder of all Europe, lies rotting
her ribs yonder, and there are no capable ships
afloat. France would love well to see us all singing
our <i>ave Marias</i> and <i>salves</i> in our deck watches,
yet she has no love for the greed of Philip. So I
say, lad, there is no present danger.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said I, “our commerce has been reduced
to less than fifty thousand tons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Softly, boy. Our carrying may not be so great
as in the days of Harry, but neither France nor Spain
carry more. For our own brave fleet of gentlemen
cruisers has made sad havoc of their barques on the
ocean, and not a Papist ship dare show her nose
within a dozen leagues of the Scilly Isles.”</p>

<p>“But these free ships have no warranty from the
Queen.”</p>

<p>“Marry, lad, you’ve the wit of a babe scarce
out of swaddling clouts. Can ye not see how the
wind sits? The Queen knows well how much she
needs these independent ships of war. For reasons
of state she may not openly encourage our enterprises;
but, laddie, I tell you she has a secret love
for them. As for warranty, what more would ye
have than that?”</p>

<p>And so saying, he put upon the bench between us
a large parchment bearing the Great Seal of State. I
scanned the document in an uncertain mood. For
it set forth with many flourishes the rights “of one
Master David Hooper to trade upon the oceans and
to use his best endeavors to restrain by forcible or
other means any enemies of Her Majesty from
doing hurt or offering hindrance to any English persons
or vessels on the high seas.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, Captain Hooper,” said I, “you are
still in the Royal Service.”</p>

<p>“We are all in the service of the Queen, lad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
This license guarantees nothing and is in fact, to
ordinary eyes, but a license to trade; and yet is it
not of greater worth than a royal commission as captain
in a navy which does not exist? A license to
trade! Ouns! and such a trade! Why, lad, what
is your ship’s cargo of wool stuffs to an after-castle
full of silver flagons and Spanish ducats—with a
taste now and then of good Papist wine to clear
the gunpowder from your throat? Let them prate.
Their undoing will be the greater. I tell you, we
gentlemen adventurers stand yet between Spain and
the mastery of the seas. It may come to pass that
one day they will try to cross the channel,—they
will never land, lad. All this and more the young
Queen knows well. For though she has a grievous
way of looking displeasure at one minute, she has as
happy a one of winking merrily the next.</p>

<p>“So it is, ye see, that Drinkwater, together with
Cobham, Tremayne, Throgmorton, and others among
us have survived both the prison and the noose and
put to sea again with no greater loss than the proportion
of the captured articles Her Majesty sees fit
to take for the replenishment of the Treasury. This
then is how the matter stands; so long as we masters
may sail successfully, making no complications with
France or the other countries to the north and east,
Queen Bess wishes us a light voyage out and a heavy
one home, and indeed delights in our tales of fortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to which she is wont to listen with sparkling eyes.
The bolder the deeds the better they are to her
liking.”</p>

<p>I listened to this secret of state with eyes agog.
Master Hooper paused in his talk long enough to
drain his pot, which he set down abruptly upon the
table.</p>

<p>“Come, Sydney,” said he with a smile, and stretching
both hands toward me, “what say ye to a
voyage with David Hooper for a shipmate, in a
bottom staunch from batts-end to keelson, the wind
and seas for servants, and never a doubt but that to-morrow
will be better than yesterday! Or perhaps
the gruntings of the swine at Tavistock hold newer
charms? What say ye?”</p>

<p>Were it in my mind to debate upon an immediate
answer, the mention of the pigs at Tavistock had
done more to remove that uncertainty than aught
else the gallant captain might have said. So I told
him that his proposition was much to my liking,
and, could I be of service, the swine at Tavistock
might be larded for a lout with better land-legs and
stomach than I.</p>

<p>Thus it was that I came to be the third in command
of the <i>Great Griffin</i> on her fourth voyage
out of Plymouth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<small>OF THE TAKING OF THE CRISTOBAL.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Like many other English ships engaged in private
enterprises at this time, the <i>Great Griffin</i>
was of no great bulk, having a tonnage of but a little
more than three hundred. Nor had she the great
after-castles and fore-castles of the Spanish galleons;
but her bulwarks were stoutly built, and high enough
to give such protection against the arrows and small
pieces of the enemy as might be necessary to those
who handled the tier of eighteen and twenty-pounders
on the main deck. The after-castle, or poop as it
had come to be called, was raised but one deck, and
here again were mounted several patereros of modern
fashion for use at short distances. The guns being
all mounted upon the upper deck, made open ports
below of no necessity; and so, even in rough weather,
all of her ordnance could be brought to bear. The
company was made up of merchant sailors and
coasters,—taken altogether a hardy lot, yet gentle
and quite unlike the reports of them which had
reached our ears from the mouths of the Spaniards.
The <i>Griffin</i> had three tall masts, and upon them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
were set sails patterned after the wonderful new
invention of Master Fletcher of Rye. For the
spars, in lieu of being made fast athwart the ship, so
set to the masts as to lay forward and aft, it being
thus possible by the hauling upon certain tackles to
shift the sails from the one side to the other with
great speed and small exertion. This invention
permitted the ship to perform the strange feat of
sailing almost directly into the wind, and allowed
great advantages in getting to windward of larger
ships. Though I had seen ships of this fashion
in the Channel, never before had I sailed in one of
them; so the easy manner of working and the simpleness
of the rigging and tackling gave me a great
pleasure.</p>

<p>Standing on the after deck and looking forward
one could note the strong lines of the barque. For,
unburdened by the tophamper of the galleons, the
bulwarks, barring the break at the fore-castle, took
a graceful curve and met above the bed of the bowsprit,
which made into the head where it was solidly
bolted to the deck below. At the forward part of
the fore-castle was mounted a great head of a
dragon, with yawning mouth and wide eyes that
looked over the waters ahead as though in search of
its rightful quarry.</p>

<p>As I looked aloft and saw the new sails yellow
and purple in the morning sun, big-bellied under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
stress of a fine breeze from the east, the stays to
windward taut as iron bars, the fellow at the helm
leaning well to the slant of the deck, methought I
had never seen so splendid a sight, and thankful
was to I be alive and able to enjoy the beauty
of it. The freshening breeze piled up the waters,
and the green of the curl topped by its filmy
cloud lifted itself to be caught in a trice and carried
down the wind against the broad bows of the
ship, or indeed at times, over the bulwarks, singing
as it flew a mellow song more pleasing to my ears
than any other earthly melody.</p>

<p>Master Hooper, by reason of his previous service,
maintained to a high degree the discipline of the
old navy; and the company of the <i>Great Griffin</i> was
thus unlike those of many of the free sailers of the
time, which for the most part were composed of
men who had used the sea in various ways but had
no knowledge of the customs aboard regular ships
of war. To gain that knowledge the men of the
<i>Griffin</i> were each day exercised at the guns and
were practised in the use of the sword and pike,
while the bowmen and arquebusiers had targets set
upon the fore-castle which they shot at from the
poop with great speed and nice judgment. The pikemen
and swordsmen had a proficiency I never saw
equaled in France or in Spain; and Master Hooper—they
called him “Davy Devil”—had an exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
which he called the fire practise, which more than
aught else showed his ingenuity in providing against
panic or mishap. Two years before, a large part of
the company had rebelled against the second in
command, who had caused one of their number to
be strung up at the mast by the thumbs. Captain
Hooper being ashore at the time, matters might
have gone badly with the officer, had not a messenger
been immediately despatched to the inn
where he was stopping. Then came Master Hooper
in great haste and caused the alarum of fire to be
sounded. So nice had been his discipline that each
man went to his appointed place, waiting there
until Master Hooper appeared upon the poop and
gave them a round speech upon the quality of obedience
as practised in the navy of Henry the Great;
to the end that, there being no fire to quench, they
quenched themselves and went about their several
duties.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day from Plymouth
we sighted a sail to the south, and discovered her
to be a crumster of New Castle, bearing French
Protestants from Havre to Bordeaux. The Captain,
Master Tremayne, related a sad tale of the
manner in which several persons who should have
gone with him were taken by the officers of the Inquisition
at Havre, as they were about to make their
escape to his vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The martial spirit of Master Hooper had done
much to shake the serenity of the merchant life out
of me, and the sight of several gentlewomen below
decks aboard the crumster, with the pink rings of
the manacles and the red scars of the fire still upon
them, so inflamed me that I vowed no feeling of
charity should stand between me and the duties of
justice. Captain Tremayne also told us that during
the night he had run afoul of a Spanish vessel of
large size, who had hailed him and was in the act of
sending boats aboard when a fog fell and he had
pulled away under its friendly cover. After some
further parley Captain Hooper set sail on the <i>Griffin</i>
and steered boldly to the south, hoping thus to
sight this Spanish sail during the afternoon; and
true enough, in the first watch a large ship was
made out under topsails and spritsail, standing for
the coast of France. Upon sighting us the stranger
hove about and took a course which the <i>Great
Griffin</i> must cross in an hour or so.</p>

<p>Master Hooper, not knowing the strength of the
ship and wishing to draw her further from the coast
where Spanish cruisers in great numbers lay in wait
for Huguenot vessels, put up his helm and stood off.
The wind however blowing smartly, he soon found
the <i>Griffin</i> to be drawing away from the stranger,
who was laboring heavily in the great seas. In
order therefore to slacken our pace without attracting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
notice, Master Hooper caused one of the spare
mainsails to be lowered over the stern. So soon as
this sail touched the water the speed of the <i>Griffin</i>
caused it to fill and act as a drag which notably
diminished our rate.</p>

<p>The Spaniard, for such the vessel now appeared,
began drawing up, until in the course of an hour or
so we could mark his tiers of guns as they frowned
out over the water to windward. So light was our
top hamper and so steady was the drag astern that
we appeared to toss but little in the seas. But the
Spaniard yawed and rolled in so frightful a manner
that the sails at times seemed hardly to be restrained
by their sheets, and flapped so noisily that they
boomed like long cannon. She went over at so
great an angle that her decks and castles crowded
with the men at the guns were plainly to be seen.</p>

<p>Yet she presented a fair sight as she came down
upon us. Despite the squall, the sun stole between
the rifts of the clouds and here and there turned the
tumbling purple mass into molten gold. The sails,
catching the glint, were bright against the darkening
horizon, and made so fair a vision that she seemed
the abode of some water-princess rather than the
battery of a horde of barbarians seeking life and unworthy
profit.</p>

<p>When she came to what may have seemed a reasonable
distance, a cloud of smoke puffed from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
point forward and a column of spray shot up from
the water at several hundred yards on our quarter.
The Spanish colors were then run up quickly, and
this movement was followed by Master Hooper, who
sent to the mainmast head the pennant of the Queen.</p>

<p>Little by little the course of the <i>Griffin</i> had been
laid to the windward, so the Spaniard now sailed at
a distance of about half a mile; and as other shots
now began falling somewhat nearer to us, the captain
ordered the tackle which secured the drag-sail
to be cast off, and they hauled it aboard. The
<i>Griffin</i>, eased of her load, sprang forward like a scurrying
cloud, the fellow at the helm moving her
closer and closer into the eye of the wind till the
starboard leeches were all a-tremble; then he held
her as she was, enabling the Spaniard to come
within gunshot.</p>

<p>The balls now fell too close for ease of mind, and
the splinters from two of them, which struck us fair
amidships, made an end to three gunners who were
at their stations. In a great ferment I saw them
carried below to the steerage, crying aloud in pitiful
fashion. Captain Hooper hereupon let his ship
go off a little to get her headway; the gunners cast
loose the long eighteen-pounders, and the after guns
were soon doing some execution in the enemy’s
rigging, and our shots still told after the Spaniard’s
shots began falling astern, or were so badly aimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
that they flew wild and did us no hurt. Seeing that
the range of the Spanish ordnance was shorter than
our own and marking our great advantage in this
matter, Captain Hooper put the ship upon the other
tack and hove her to with the wind to the larboard,
thus enabling the entire starboard broadside to
be got into action. The roll of the <i>Griffin</i> greatly
disturbed the gunners, but after some minutes, by
firing high upon the roll to leeward, many shots flew
straight for the Spaniard, so that soon we saw first
his bowsprit and sail, and then his foremast go by
the board.</p>

<p>There was a great commotion behind me, and I
turned to see a fellow jumping up and down and
slapping his thigh in great glee. “How now, sir,”
I said, somewhat sternly, “are you mad?”</p>

<p>He turned to me with a grin.</p>

<p>“’Twill be poor smellin’ in the Bay o’ Bisky, say
I. Did ye see me snip off his nose? Did ye? ’Twas
my shot, sir. He’ll want a bigger ’kerchief than a
spritsail now, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p>The wreck so encumbered the deck of the Spaniard
that it was some minutes before any order could
be brought about and the galleon again put to the
wind. Master Hooper clewed up his lower sails,
eased off his sheets, and taking up a position on the
enemy’s weather-quarter poured in at easy range a
fire which swept the crowded decks and created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a panic among the Spanish gunners. The cries of
the wounded and dying we could hear faintly, but
by the movements of the officers on the after-castle,
who ran here and there brandishing their swords,
we were able to surmise a sad lack of discipline
among the company. On the <i>Griffin</i> the divisions
waited for the word of command from the officers,
firing thereupon with great regularity and precision.
Though now, as we came again into range, the
Spanish shots told here and there, and great white
splinters flew in all directions, such men as were
unhurt remained at their stations, the injured among
them being replaced by others from those detailed
to navigate the ship.</p>

<p>So unwieldy was our adversary that she could
not come up into the wind because of the great
encumbrance of her head gear, and so was forced
to wear around; and as she did so, Davy Devil
who had been awaiting this opportunity to rake,
fired the entire larboard broadside. The <i>Griffin</i>,
no longer lying in the trough of the sea, sailed
more steadily than before, and the effect of
this broadside was terrific. Not less than four
shots went through the ports of the Spaniard’s after-castle
and one, more lucky than the others, passed
just over the rail and struck the mainmast below the
yard, and over it went on the next roll to leeward,
the tackling dragging with it the mizzen-topmast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
which flew asunder at the cap with a crackling heard
loudly above the booming of the ordnance.</p>

<p>“She’ll need a new bonnet, Master Killigrew, to
be in the fashion again,” said Davy Devil behind
me.</p>

<p>We could not at this time have been at a greater
distance than two cable-lengths and Master Hooper,
believing the enemy about to strike his colors,
brought his sails home and directed the helmsman
to haul up alongside. No sign being heard or seen,
two anchors were got out and men lay aloft on the
yards ready to cast them upon the Spaniard’s decks.
Three,—four minutes, Master Hooper waited, withholding
his shot. Then, the Spanish demi-culverins
again opening fire upon us to our great disadvantage,
the word was given to discharge another broadside,
the gunners then to crouch behind the bulwarks and
cubbridges and prepare to board.</p>

<p>No ship could have withstood the shock of this
fire! For discharged at such close range the shots
tore through the bulwarks and planking with a horrid
sound, the splinters, as we found, killing and maiming
many who had gone below for protection.</p>

<p>At this moment a single tall figure appeared upon
the after-castle making a signal of submission.
Upon which Master Hooper sheered off and hove
the <i>Griffin</i> into the wind that he might mind his
damages and care for his wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The weather having moderated, a boat was called
away to go aboard the prize, and Master Hooper
giving me charge, I put off for the Spaniard. On
account of the heavy sea still running the boarding
of the vessel was no easy task. In spite of the dismantled
rigging which lay over her sides, she wallowed
far down in the trough like a shift-ballast, the
seas dashing against her and lashing the foam over
her waist in feathery clouds. At length, with some
difficulty, the coxswain hooked a ring-bolt in her side
to leeward and I hauled myself over the bulwarks.</p>

<p>On deck a gruesome sight awaited us. The
wreckage of the foremast and the yards lay where
they had fallen and obscured the view of the
fore-castle where a party of the company were
hacking away at the wreck with their axes and
swords. The ship was flush-decked in the waist,
after the fashion of vessels in the carrying trade, and
the men who worked the guns had thus been exposed
to the worst of our fire which had raked them
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en echelon</i>—as the French have it—from foremast to
poop. Many of the cannon, small culverins and
swivels of Italian make, were dismounted and lay
askew, frowning inboard. Piled here and there were
bodies, many lacking in human semblance and
presenting a ghastly spectacle after the cleanly decks
of the <i>Great Griffin</i>.</p>

<p>Moving carefully over the slippery decks, I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
at last to the poop, below which stood one who, by
reason of his immense stature, towered head and
shoulders above those around him. I am not like
to forget this early impression made upon my mind
by Diego de Baçan; for, surrounded as he was by a
scene of blood, there seemed some demoniac sympathy
between his figure and the carnage about him.
There was that in the contour of his face which reminded
me of the doughty Ojeda, possessing a hideous
beauty like only to that of the evil one. The sun
behind him glinted on the visor of his morion from
the shadow of which his eyes gleamed darkly. His
black beard, which came at two points, framed in a
jaw set squarely enough on his great neck, and his
wide shoulders even over-topped mine both for
breadth and height. He leaned easily with one
hand upon the rail, looking, in his polished breast
piece, so splendid that I could not but mark the
difference between his garb and mine, which was
but that of the merchant seaman, ungarnished by
any trappings of war.</p>

<p>Scorning the salute I proffered him, he spoke
coldly, in English, without further ado.</p>

<p>“You would speak with me, señor?”</p>

<p>“My mission,” I replied, “is with the commander
of this ship. If you are he, you will go with me
yonder.”</p>

<p>“The commander of the <i>San Cristobal</i> is dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
I am Don Diego de Baçan. But I will go aboard
no heretic pirato.”</p>

<p>“We are no pirato, señor,” said I calmly, “but
a free sailer of Her Majesty, Elizabeth of England,
whom you have attacked without warrant.”</p>

<p>“And if I will not go?” Here he drew himself
up to his great height, folded his arms and
frowned at me defiantly, while a dozen or so of his
pikemen stood at his back and scowled fiercely.
But, in my position, black looks caused no tremors.</p>

<p>“If you will not come,” I answered steadily, “my
orders are to bring you,—this I will do; failing to
return before the next stroke of the bell, my captain
will sink you as he would a rotten pinnace.”</p>

<p>He looked about him at the scene of havoc, and
smiled bitterly. Then, with a word to his pikemen,
who still surrounded us, his manner changed.</p>

<p>“Señor,” he said more quietly, “you see how it
is with us. The <i>Cristobal</i> takes water at every
surge. She is a wreck. What am I to do? To continue
the battle were only to sacrifice the remainder
of my company. I must surrender.” He cast
down his eyes. “Yes, there is no help for it. I
will go with you. But if, señor,” and here he
raised his head and eyed me like a hawk from cap
to boot, “if you deem your victory one of personal
prowess and have the humor for further
argument, I shall meet your pleasure.” His words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
came calmly, yet he leaned forward and seemed
about to raise his hands toward me. I folded my
arms and looked him in the eyes. They had lost
their quiet and flashed at me furiously. His great
fingers twitched nervously as though to catch me
at the throat. He was glorious. And then I made
a vow that, so far as it lay in my power when time
and place fitted, his taunt should have an issue.</p>

<p>“Why, that will be as it may be,” I replied evenly,
“at present you are to follow me aboard my ship.”
Seeing my attitude, he grew calmer and shrugging
his shoulders, turned away.</p>

<p>“As you will;” and then after a pause, half courteously,
“You will permit me to give some final
orders?”</p>

<p>“Orders in future must come from my captain.”</p>

<p>“But, señor,” he cried, “these are but some matters
relating to the repair of the ship.”</p>

<p>Seeing no harm in this, I allowed him to turn
and speak in a low tone to one of his pikemen, whereupon
the fellow went below.</p>

<p>The <i>Griffin</i> had meanwhile hauled up within
speaking distance and, mounting the after-castle, I
hailed Captain Hooper, acquainting him with the
condition of affairs aboard the <i>Cristobal</i>. The
weather being still too rough to heave the <i>Griffin</i>
alongside, I obtained further instructions to bring
the Spanish officer aboard that the disposition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the prisoners and other matters might be more
readily discussed and considered.</p>

<p>So ill-governed was the crew that as we got down
into the boat the pikemen and gunners leaned far
over the bulwarks, cursing us for dogs of heretics,
and one of them spat in the face of a sailor named
Salvation Smith, who would have killed him with a
boatpike had not the coxswain, Job Goddard, stayed
his hand. The wind now blew less vigorously and,
though the sea still ran high, there seemed less
danger than on the outward passage. But, as we
rounded out from under the lee of the Spaniard, my
fine fellows setting their broad backs to the stroke,
there came from one of the gallery ports a cry of
distress, the voice of a woman,</p>

<p>“<a href="#image02">A moi! a moi!</a> For God’s sake, help!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<a name="image02" id="image02">
  <img src="images/image02.jpg" width="389" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_24">“<em><span class="smcap">A moi! a moi!</span></em>”</a></div>
</div>

<p>The oars hung for a moment in the air as though
the sound of those English words had stricken the
boatmen motionless. Then as I half rose from the
thwart, with one accord the starboard oars gave a
mighty stroke and the bow of the boat swung over
under the many-galleried stern of the <i>Cristobal</i>. A
glance at the port showed a face and the flutter of
a kerchief, while from within came the clashing of
metal and the curses of men. As we swung in, a
piece of wreckage and tackling hung near us and
when our stern rose on the crest of the wave, I could
reach it, and hauled myself clear of the boat and up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the projection of the lowermost gallery. As I raised
myself I saw two boats drop from the side of the
<i>Griffin</i> and knew I should not long be without aid.
On reaching the port the sound of the conflict
became more distinct and I heard the hard breathing
of the disputants; so without more ado, I raised
myself over the sill with an effort and clambered in.</p>

<p>Before the door leading to the passage of the half-deck
a tall, slim figure in sombre garb moved from
side to side, making so excellent a play with his
sword, that the pikemen who were thrusting at him
furiously from the narrow corridor had small advantage.
A woman lay upon the floor and another
crouched in the corner. On seeing me come forward
one of the pikemen fell back, but the other
aimed so vicious a blow at the swordsman that, had
he not been thrown aside, it must surely have ended
him. The force of the thrust threw the villain forward
into the cabin, where, being off his guard by
reason of his pike handle fouling the doorjamb, he
came within reach of my hand, which struck him
full in the mouth, laying him sprawling over a sea
chest. Salvation Smith, singing a psalm, and Job
Goddard, swearing loudly, here tumbled in at the
port and following into the passage laid about them
lustily with their weapons, to the end that in a few
seconds the place was cleared and the outer door
made fast. To our great amazement no further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
attempt was made upon the door, nor indeed was
there any commotion above us or on the deck; but
upon returning to the port the reason of this was
clear, for the four boats of the <i>Griffin</i> were sweeping
around the stern, the fellows lying to their oars with
vigor and the pikemen standing upright, their jaws
set and the glitter of battle in their eyes. Over the
<i>Cristobal</i> they came swarming, driving the men
forward where they huddled upon the fore-castle
like a slave cargo. They had no spirit, for not a
shot or an arrow was fired, and Master Hooper found
himself in undisputed possession of the prize.</p>

<p>Having now no further alarm for the outcome of
the affair, I directed the door to be unfastened and
turned my attention to those within the cabin.</p>

<p>I have never made boast of courtly ways, thinking
them mere glitterings and fripperies of the idle,
designed to hide a lack of sturdier qualities. Few
women had I known, and in my boisterous life no
need had come for handsome phrases, yet would I
have given whatever interest I possessed or might
come to possess in this or other prizes, for the
readiness of wit to clothe my rough speech in more
courtly apparel. There was a quality of nobility
and grace in the figure of the maid in the cabin that
cast my rugged notions to the winds and made me
seem the swash-buckler that I was. In stature she
was tall and carried herself with the pride and dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that are ever the birthright of true nobility.
No exact description can I put down of the appearance
and demeanor of Mademoiselle Diane de la
Notte; for not poetry but only dull prose can run
from my unmannerly quill. I only know that a radiance
was shed upon me, and all the senses save
that one which controlled my heart were blinded and
inert. So acute indeed was this feeling of my moral
littleness that I did naught but stand shifting from
one foot to the other, toying in silly fashion with the
hilt of my sword. Had it not been for the maid herself
I know not what uncomely thing I might have
done. But Madame, who had lain swooning on the
floor, now recovering consciousness and thus removing
her anxiety Mademoiselle raised her head and
spoke to me.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, we do not know what is your calling or
command—whether adventurer or Queen’s officer—but
you are a valiant man,” saying other things I so
little deserved that I cast down my eyes and replied
in some embarrassment that my men, not I,
deserved her kindness—God knows what we had
done was little enough and easy of accomplishment.</p>

<p>But she would not have it so, adding further, “The
La Nottes are not ungrateful and their blessings will
fall forever on you, sir. It may happen that your
service may one day have its reward. But now,”—and
a deep sigh burst from her, “alas! we can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
nothing, not even for ourselves—nothing!” It
seemed as though her voice were about to break, but
bending quickly forward she applied herself anew to
Madame lying at her knee, the picture of feminine
strength even in despair. I was so affected by her
anguish that I could find no words to say to her,
and while I still wondered who could seek to do
them injury, I moved to the Sieur de la Notte, who
sat upon a chest staunching the blood which flowed
freely from a pike wound in his wrist. He was
much exhausted by his encounter, so I aided him to
bind his arm, after which I withdrew and went
upon the deck to make my report to Master Hooper.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<small>MADEMOISELLE.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">After awhile the Sieur de la Notte came on
deck to Master Hooper and disclosed the
story of his persecution and the circumstances which
led to his capture and imprisonment. His tale was,
in short, the tale of a hundred others. He had become
a follower of Calvin and had even preached and
written the new religion. His estates were soon
confiscated and he was forced to flee into the night
with his wife and daughter, carrying only the jewels
and valuables to which he could lay his hands.</p>

<p>“And what, Monsieur,” asked Master Hooper,
when he had done, “of your adventure in the
cabin?”</p>

<p>“That is soon told. When the action began, the
commander of the <i>Cristobal</i>, Don Alvarez, sent us
below, cautioning us not to appear upon the deck.
Don Diego de Baçan himself locked us in the after
cabin. The battle over there came a sudden movement
at the outer door and two pikemen rushed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the corridor and set upon me vigorously. So sudden
was the onslaught I had scarce time to set myself on
guard. But I managed to draw and use my sword
to such good end as to confine the fellows in the narrow
passageway, where I had them at a disadvantage.
Yet, what might have come of us had not
yonder giant interposed——”</p>

<p>“But the cause of this attack?” asked Captain
Hooper.</p>

<p>“You must know, Monsieur,” replied the Frenchman,
“that under the deck of that cabin is a chest
containing many thousand crowns. It was upon the
Huguenot ship from which we were taken and was
intended by Admiral Coligny for certain troops
under arms in the north.” Captain Hooper’s eyes
sparkled. He would have liked to take that chest
upon the <i>Griffin</i>. But he had his orders and dared
not without the consent of the Queen take even salvage
of treasure or property belonging to the Protestant
party.</p>

<p>“Captain Hooper,” said I, “the orders for the
murder of this gentleman came from the officer, Don
Diego de Baçan.” And I related my own imprudence
in allowing the Spaniard to communicate with
his bowmen.</p>

<p>“H’m! ’Twas a foolish thing,” said Master
Hooper, stroking his chin, “but, lad, you’ve atoned
for your fault in handsome fashion. And now out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
with spare yards and masts and try for some steerage
way on this storied hayrick.”</p>

<p>There being many bad injuries, the <i>Cristobal</i> took
water rapidly and Master Hooper sent all of her
crew to removing it. The men mounted stages
set at places beyond the reach of the water and
made such repairs as would enable her to reach
port, provided the weather grew no worse. The
injuries below water were stopped from inboard,
the wreck was partially cleared, jury masts and temporary
spars were rigged in place of those shot away,
and, with a wind on the quarter, the <i>Griffin</i> and her
prize moved to the eastward toward the coast of
France. The <i>Griffin</i> having even more than her
complement of men, it was thought best by Captain
Hooper to send aboard the <i>Cristobal</i> a large prize
crew, of which he made me commander. Many of
the more important prisoners were put aboard the
<i>Griffin</i> or taken below on the <i>Cristobal</i>, where they
were confined in the fore-castle. To my great satisfaction
the family of the Vicomte de la Notte were
passengers to the city of Dieppe, where they had
friends. A matter much less to my liking was the
company of Don Diego de Baçan, whose presence
even in confinement seemed to me a menace to the
safety of the ship and her precious cargo. But it
was so ordered by Captain Hooper, for at Dieppe
the Spaniard might be exchanged for English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
seamen imprisoned there as hostages at the demands
of Spain. The <i>Cristobal</i> as a prize was to
be made over formally to certain agents of Captain
Hooper. These agents, who were French, it is said
were in the employ of the Queen, but I doubted
this after my dealings with them. Having sold the
<i>Cristobal</i> and placed the recaptured treasure in the
hands of Admiral Coligny, I was to rejoin the <i>Griffin</i>
at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the second day the <i>Griffin</i>
put her helm up and set a straight course for
the coast of Ireland, to refit at Kinsale, where
Master Hooper kept his goods and stores. All effort
having been made to insure a safe voyage I stood
at the weather rigging upon the quarter-deck, thinking
of many things. I marveled at the wonderful
power which had drawn me from myself and made
my rough hulk seem to me but the abode of a carnal
spirit. Having no quarrel with the world except in
matters relating to the betterment of my condition, I
had grown in my rugged health and brute strength
further and further from the more delicate sensibilities
which go to make the better part of human
life. It was my own fault. I knew that. I could
have gone into the horse-company of my uncle with
a chance for preferment and a life of polite groveling
at the skirts of royalty. Though I had read
much of such books as were to be found in my way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and picked up a smattering of the languages, a dozen
years of service in all weathers and companies had
cudgeled from me many feelings of the gentler
kind which I believe are nature’s gifts to all right-thinking
gentlefolk.</p>

<p>But I had chosen my life for myself and there was
an end of it. I compared myself, beside Mademoiselle,
to a clumsy rock crumster against the gilded pinnace
of the Queen where every line is beauty and strength.
I watched her as she walked the deck with Madame.
Although the <i>Cristobal</i> lay over to leeward and
blundered heavily through the seas, raising her head
and stern in abrupt fashion, Mademoiselle walked the
slanting deck straightly, conversing quietly the while
and cheering Madame, who leaned upon her. Her
carriage, though lissome, gained from the set of the
head a certain dignity and grace that marked her as
a queen among women—perhaps a little haughty but
in it the more queenly. But I would not be so interpreted
as to show her in any sense cold of temper,
for as I stood there watching her, my heart in my
eyes, from time to time she turned and flashed a
warm glance upon me, which sealed each time more
surely my destiny as her willing servitor.</p>

<p>In a little while the prisoners were brought up
from below for their airing and Mademoiselle went
with Madame below to the cabin. The Spaniards,
taken altogether, were a well enough looking company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and I do not doubt that under proper authority
and better conditions of ordnance and seamanship,
could have given a good account of themselves.
As it was, they seemed well cowed and came up from
their quarters sheepishly, blinking their eyes like so
many cats at the brightness of the sun. There came
also among the last Don Diego de Baçan. Lifting
his great bulk over the combing of the hatchway
he scanned the horizon as though mechanically and,
seeing nothing, turned toward me. I had not given
much of my thought to this fellow, for with the
many necessary orders and duties in getting the
<i>Cristobal</i> to rights and under way my mind had
been so occupied as to harbor no place for plans or
business of my own. Yet the memory of the
haughty taunt of the Spaniard rankled in me, and I
promised myself an ungodly pleasure in a further
discussion of the subject. As the ranking officer
among the prisoners, I had allotted him the half of
my cabin, but my business upon the deck having
been so urgent, I had not as yet had any talk with
him.</p>

<p>The mist of years passes over our eyes and brains,
dimming the memories of youthful impulses and
madnesses. Yet even now, as I recall the face of
De Baçan, handsome, sneering, powerful,—his look
of contempt at all things,—my pulses beat the more
quickly and my hand again goes to the place where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
my sword was wont to hang. It is said that in
the matter of love and the taking in marriage, each
person may find upon the earth a mate; likewise
it seems to me most natural that for each man upon
the earth at least one other may be born who shall
be his natural adversary and enemy. It was once
told me by Martin Cockrem that two churls entered
the inn-yard at the Pelican and without exchange of
words, or laying eyes on each other ever before,
fell instantly to fighting. Setting aside the danger
which lay in his presence and the grievance I
bore him for his attack upon the Sieur de la Notte,
a like feeling of antipathy there was between the
Spaniard and me. And as he came forward, my
fingers closed so that the nails drove into the flesh
and I took a step toward him. Yet he was a prisoner
of war, promised to be safely delivered. So,
half ashamed of my own impatience, I bit my lip for
the better control of my speech and leaned back
upon the taffrail smiling.</p>

<p>“You have not given me the honor of your
company in my prison,” said he, with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Nay, señor,” I returned, “the <i>Cristobal</i> is a
sieve, and but for certain precautions might now be
floating keelson upward. My company you shall
have when other things are righted, for there is a
small matter for discussion.”</p>

<p>“And what, Señor Pirato?” he asked with a lift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of the chin. “What matter is common between you
and me?”</p>

<p>“Permit me to be the judge of that, señor. And
upon the <i>Cristobal</i> the subject may be settled.”</p>

<p>“Oho! You crow loud as a fledgling cock with
your weighty subjects!”</p>

<p>“My weighty subjects are less weighty than my
fists,” I replied, for I liked him not, striving hard
meanwhile to preserve my peace. “You saw fit to
put an insult upon me and did me the honor of an
offer of a further argument of the question. I accept
that offer.”</p>

<p>He placed his hands upon his hips and looked at
me from head to foot as at a person he had never
seen before. And then his white teeth gleamed
through his black mustache as he smiled.</p>

<p>“You are a bold stripling. Why, Sir Swashbuckler,
the prowess of Don de Baçan is a byword
in the navy of King Philip, and no man in all Spain
has bested him in any bout of strength. Yet, look
you, I like your bulk and manner and it may be that
I shall see fit to honor you with a test of endurance.”</p>

<p>“’Tis no honor that I seek, señor,” said I, giving
him smile for smile, “but the satisfaction of a small
personal grievance which may be righted quickly.
And though your bulk is fit enough for my metal,
your manner pleases me not;” for it galled me that
he should continue to speak of me as a pirato upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
my own command; and my blood boiled at the
thought of what he had attempted to work upon
the Sieur de la Notte and Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>“My thews may please you even less, Sir Adventurer.
Mark you this,”—and leaning over, he took
from one of the guns a chocking quoin of hickory-wood
banded with copper. Seizing it in his hands
he placed it between his knees for a better purchase
and, bending forward quickly, with a mighty wrench,
he split it in two parts as one would split an apple;
whereat I was greatly surprised, and knew for certain
that I had no ordinary giant to deal with. But I
held and still hold, that like most of such feats, it was
but a trick and come of long practise. I might have
shown him, had I wished, the breaking of a pike-staff
with a hand-width grasp; for in this there is no
great skill but only honest elbow sinew. Yet I had
no humor to put him on his guard against me.</p>

<p>Some of my surprise may have noted itself in my
face, for he laughed boastfully as he threw the quoin
upon the deck. “So will I split you,—if your humor
is unchanged.”</p>

<p>I laughed back in his face.</p>

<p>“If your quoins are as rotten as your ship, I fear
you not. To-morrow we make the coast. To-night,
if it meets your convenience we will meet upon the
fore-castle.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” he said with a shrug of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
shoulders, “yet I have warned you. And if blood
be spilled by accident——”</p>

<p>“It will not be mine! Until then, señor,” and
bowing, I made my way below to inquire if Mademoiselle
wished for anything.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<small>OF MY BOUT WITH DE BAÇAN.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">I met her coming out of the passageway which
led to the after-cabin. Holding out her hand to
me, she said frankly, “I came to seek you, Master
Killigrew.” Her manner was one of friendliness and
trust, and so filled my heart with gratitude that at first
I did not note the anxiety which showed in her eyes.
We moved to an embrasure by one of the casements.
There she seated herself upon a gun-carriage and
motioned me to a place at her side.</p>

<p>“God knows, Master Killigrew, that we are deep
in your debt,” she began. “You are the only one
my father has trusted since we fled from Villeneuve.
But there is much that you should know.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I replied, “my devotion to your
interests or cause——”</p>

<p>There may have been more of ardor in my tones
than I meant to show, for I fancied a pink, rosy color
came to her neck and cheeks.</p>

<p>“We have good reason to believe in your honesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of purpose, Master Killigrew,” she said hastily, “and
my present talk is further proof of confidence. The
matter concerns Don Diego de Baçan and ourselves.
This Spaniard has no good will for my father.”</p>

<p>“But, Mademoiselle, has he—?”</p>

<p>“You and your captain thought that the reason
for the attack lay in his hope to conceal the money
in the cabin. That was not all. When we were
first taken aboard the <i>Cristobal</i> he gave me the
honor of his admiration. The following day he
sought me on many pretexts. I,—believing that
the comfort and peace of Madame, my mother, depended
upon diplomacy,—allowed him to sit and
talk with me. At last, his speech becoming little
to my liking, I refused him further admittance
and told the Sieur de la Notte of my annoyance.”</p>

<p>I rose from the seat.</p>

<p>“No, listen! Listen to me,” she continued.
“Then—’twas only three days before the encounter
with the <i>Great Griffin</i>—my father sought Don Alvarez
and told him the facts as I relate them, demanding
the courtesies due to honorable prisoners
of war. This request was disregarded and Don
Diego came at all hours to our cabin, into which,
the door lock having been removed, he entered at
whatever hour he pleased.”</p>

<p>She may have marked my manner, which as the
narrative proceeded, grew from joy at her confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to surprise, anger and then rage at the Spaniard,
which as I sat there seemed like to overmaster me.
I could say no word, but for better control kept my
eyes fixed upon the deck. There was much, I knew,
beneath that story which she had sweetly robbed of
its harshness to guard me from rash impulse. And
so I sat there, transfixed.</p>

<p>“I have told this because I think it best to guard
against him when we reach the coast. De Baçan
has sworn that he will possess me. I know there is
naught he will not attempt to keep his word. There
is no evil he would not work upon us or upon you to
gain his ends. For myself I fear nothing, but he
hates my father with a deadly hatred and Madame
must be saved from further suffering if the means
lie in our power. Oh! what would I not give for
the bones and sinews of a man like you who has but
to order and the thing is done!”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly and cast down her eyes as
though the manner of her speech had been too
strong and unwomanly. And I, who sat there,
turned from cold with hatred of the Spaniard, to
warm with love of her. For in spite of the distance
between us, the speech came impulsively from the
heart and made me more than ever desire to justify
her confidence.</p>

<p>“I cannot say, Mademoiselle,” I replied gravely,
“that there will not be danger, for there is treachery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in Dieppe. But many strong hearts stand
between you and this De Baçan.”</p>

<p>Her hand lay upon the breeching of the gun beside
us; small and very white it was, ornamented
with a ring of ancient setting and workmanship.
Without meditation and eased of my boorishness by
some subtle influence that drew me to her, I took it
in my fingers and raised it to my lips. Then, astonished
at my audacity—for I had never done so
strange a thing, I drew back, hot and awkward. But
at once she set me at my ease and would not have
it so.</p>

<p>“Nay, sir,” she said warmly, “if you are to serve
us truly I would not have a better seal for the contract.”</p>

<p>Upon which, still in great ferment of mind, I
straightway made the compact doubly sure.</p>

<p>She then left me, seeking the cabin, while I went
upon the deck, intent upon settling the business in
hand.</p>

<p>The wind now blew freshly from the north and
the spray came over the waist, cutting sharply
against my face as I went forward. Job Goddard
lay upon his back upon the tarpaulin of the forward
hatchway, while Salvation Smith read aloud portions
of a book of tales relating to the lives of the Christian
martyrs. At times, in impressive pauses in the reading
by the pious one, Goddard would raise himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
upon one elbow and curse lustily—his usual mode
of expressing admiration for the martyrs and their
sponsor; for in Salvation lay the makings of a most
bigoted and godly reformer. Job Goddard swore by
all things under heaven and upon all occasions—when
that mode of speech seemed least fitting or appropriate;
and the book of the martyrs was but a part
of Salvation’s instruction in simple and pious thought.
Yet they were both goodly fighters—in a place of
great difficulty being worth at the least four Englishmen,
six Spaniards or eight Frenchmen. The very
sound of the clashing of steel pike-heads or the report
of an arquebuse set them upon the very edge of
their mettle, and so the prospect of a fair engagement
caused them so great a joy that even devotion
to their principles came to be forgotten. I therefore
knew that the business I had in hand would
meet with ready response.</p>

<p>“To-night,” said I, without further ado, “there
is to be a bout.” Smith closed the “Martyrs” with
celerity and Goddard began to swear.</p>

<p>“Glory be, Job! Who, Master Killigrew?”</p>

<p>“Odds ’oonds, Jem! What is it, sir?”</p>

<p>“There is to be a test between the Spaniard, De
Baçan and myself.”</p>

<p>In a moment they were all excitement, slapping
each other upon the back and making a great commotion.
When they were quiet again I gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
their instructions. There were to be no arms. For
could I not crush him into submission with my own
will and sinews, then—well—I had met my match or
better. But I did not think of that. We would
fight at twelve o’clock upon the fore-castle, for there
we would be undisturbed. Two Spanish prisoners
of De Baçan’s choice were to stand by him, and
Goddard and Salvation Smith were to stand by me
to see justice done. The details being agreed upon
I despatched a message by Goddard to the Spaniard
acquainting him with the plans; to which there
being no reply, I deemed them satisfactory.</p>

<p>The night came up dark and windy. But toward
six bells the fresh breeze piled the clouds away
to the west and the moon came out, lighting up the
deck and glimmering upon the bright work of the
lanterns. Prompt upon the stroke of eight bells I
caused word to be sent to De Baçan. When he
appeared, his cloak was thrown about his shoulders
but I could see he wore no doublet, having only his
shirt, hose, and a pair of short boots. It pleased me
to know he had thought proper to make some
preparation for the work, for I now felt that the
matter was not altogether indifferent to him, and
that, in the quieter moments of his cabin, he had
given me credit for some hardihood.</p>

<p>Now as I measured him by my own stature it
seemed indeed as though he had the advantage in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
height, though I much doubt if he had really my
breadth of shoulder or my length of arm, which
were second to no man I had met. But the symmetry
and grace of his figure were perfect. The light
shone through the thin shirt and I marked the
great muscles behind the shoulders as they played
when he moved his arms. The collar was open and
I could note the swell of the breast muscles as they
lay in layers like rows of cordage from breastbone
to arm-pit. The thighs were smaller than mine,
but there was more of grace and more of sinew both
there and at the calf, the ball of which played just
at the boot top. His eye was bold and clear and
he looked at me steadily from the moment he came
upon the deck, seeking, in a way I had seen practised,
to create a feeling of uneasiness and uncertainty.
This look of his eyes I took to be but a
part of the method of intimidation he had worked
upon others, and it only served to make me more
wary of the tricks I knew he would play should
sheer strength not suffice.</p>

<p>He at once made several tries upon my arm which
I held forward to ward a sudden rush below the
guard. Knowing that my youth and clean living
might give me advantage in a long struggle, I was
content for the moment to stand upon guard and
suffered him to play around me, my eyes fixed upon
his, every look of which I followed and read. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
so heavy a man, he stepped with wonderful alacrity
and sprang from this side to that with such
speed that he puzzled me. Finding, however, by
reason of my length of reach that he could get
no hold, he began trying different methods. The
extension guard has been thought of some advantage
and the German, Brandt, has practised it with
success, yet I counted not upon the wonderful quickness
of the man. By feinting for finding a catch
upon my shoulder, he sprang in, catching me handily
with a gripe of his left arm upon my neck and back.
So fiercely he came that my right arm was pinioned;
yet my left elbow met him in the middle of the
breast below the bone, and I stood firm upon my
legs, which were more stocky of build than his, and
met the assault strongly.</p>

<p>As he closed in, the arm upon my back and neck
took a firmer hold and the hand came over my right
shoulder from the back, seeking a purchase at the
neck. The strain he put upon my body was terrible,
so terrible that for the moment all the breath
seemed like to be squeezed from out my lungs.
Backward we strained a foot or so, when, as he eased
his gripe to get a better purchase upon the back,
my right arm came a trifle freer and I found a use
for my hand which now got a hold upon his shoulder
muscles. My nails bit deep into the flesh and I
plucked between my palm and fingers a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
muscle out of tension, and felt for the moment I
could hold my own. He still had an advantage
of me in the gripe; and though the pressure upon
my body was not so great as at the beginning,
my breath came with difficulty. He seemed in little
better condition, for he breathed hard, and I knew
the chance blow of the elbow in the breast had
robbed him of some of his staying power. Try as
he might, his arms about me, his head bent forward
upon my chest, he could not at first bend my neck.
Backward and forward we moved, each of us bringing
forth all the strength we could, neither of us
able to gain. Then, the strain put upon me being
more than mortal flesh could stand, little by little I
went back until I came down upon one knee.</p>

<p>The agony of that moment! He put forth all
his power and tried to break my back with a
terrific wrench which must have ended me had
not my new position given a side purchase upon
him. Seeing that so long as my right hand shoulder
gripe remained he could not get the full play
of strength in his left arm, he bore down with
his entire weight. In this I humored him till he
got me high enough when, though still suffering
grievously, I shifted my gripe and took him with
both arms, one up one down, just below his ribs.
Swinging half to the right and using all the power
left me, I half arose and buttocked him fairly, sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
him in a great half circle and loosing his gripe
upon my chest. Yet the strain he had put upon me
had weakened me so sorely that, ere I could come
upon him to follow up my sudden advantage, he had
broken loose and gained his feet for a further trial.</p>

<p>“Body o’ me, lad, ’twas handily done,” came from
Goddard in an awed whisper; I marked a reverential
“Heart o’ grace,” from Smith at my back, “now
look out for him, sir!”</p>

<p>Indeed the face of the Spaniard was dreadful to
see. He stood for the moment, his legs apart,
staggering from the shock of the fall. His breath
came hard and his eyes gleamed wickedly. At me
he came and with a desperateness I might not mistake.
As we sprang into each other’s grasp, there
followed a test of endurance such as I had never
before been put to—nor will again. In turn he
tried the cross buttock, the back hank and back
heel, but I managed to meet him at all points,
though in sore straits for lack of wind. I had ten
years advantage in the matter of age, and the life
he had led had doubtless sapped his vigor. For
as we struggled back and forth I noticed that his
gripe had lost a part of its power and his offensive
play was weaker. It seemed as though he lay upon
his oars awaiting the chance for a trick. By and
by he used it.</p>

<p>His left hand became disengaged and the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
wiry fingers fastened a fierce clutch upon my
throat, which I could not free. He had me from
the left side and I could not well return his dastardly
compliment. But as I felt my power a-going,
by loosing the clasp of my left arm, I seized
him from behind, my right hand going around
his neck and my fingers getting a fair good hold
in his beard just below the turn of the chin.
Here I had the advantage. For he had taken me
low down on the neck where the stronger muscles
are and feared to loose his gripe; while my clasp
tightened till I felt my thumb and fingers meet on
the nether side of the windpipe. So great a rage I
had at his taking me foully that I knew not what I
did and as we fell I brought all my strength into play.
Though he fell on top of me and my breath was
gone, I knew that not death itself could have loosed
the clutch I put upon him. I saw as through a
mist the mouth open and shut hideously, the eyes,
wide with terror, come from their sockets and the
skin turn black almost as the beard that half hid it.
The hand upon my neck lost its sinew, the muscles
of the arm relaxed and the Spaniard dropped over
to one side nerveless and powerless though still
struggling against me. The fury did not die out of
me at once and it seemed as though my fingers only
gripped him the harder. Then, I know not what,—perhaps
some weak and womanish pity at his strait,—caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
me to loose my hold upon the throat, which
I might have torn out from his body as one would
unstrand a hempen cable.</p>

<p>God knows why I did this thing! Perhaps it was
destiny that I should have spared him. In the light
of after events, it seems as though some stronger
hand than mine had set for us the life that followed.
Had I killed him this account would never
have been written, nor would I have gained the further
friendship of Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>But I would set all sail ere my anchor is well clear.
By all the rules of the game the Spaniard had given
me the right to his life. Would to God I had taken
it, even as he lay there prone and helpless. As it
was I stumbled to my feet and with Goddard and
Smith, stood waiting for De Baçan to rise. At first
I had not noted the disappearance of his seconds,
for the terrible earnestness of the bout had blinded
me to all but the matter in hand.</p>

<p>In answer to my question Job Goddard said,</p>

<p>“Odds me! It was about the buttock, sir, which
he said was done different in Spain. Mebbe I was
over-rapid in demonstratin’ my meanin’ an’ view of
the question. But I did him no hurt, sir,—curse me
if I did!”</p>

<p>The other man sat terrified in the shadow of the
foremast, but upon my suggestion he went to De
Baçan, aiding him to arise and go to the cabin below.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
<small>DIEPPE.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">The following day we passed up to the city
of Dieppe, and came to anchor in the river
of Arques without further mishap. I had seen
nothing of the Spaniard since the night before. I
could not wonder that he had not chosen to show
himself upon the deck; if it were true that he had
bested all contestants at feats of strength, then
surely his defeat must have rankled in him. He had
probably no more desire to see me than I had to see
him; but there was business to be done in the city
which concerned him and his exchange for the English
hostages.</p>

<p>My arms and back were so sore with the straining
he had given me that it cost many an ache to bend
over into the hatchway. I felt in worse plight than
he, for further than showing a cloth about his neck
and a certain huskiness in the voice he gave no sign
of rough handling. He made no move to arise from
his stool as I entered the cabin. He turned his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in my direction, looking sullen and angry as any
great bull. But it was not the imperious look he
bore after the sea battle; it was rather the eye-challenge
of one man for another of equal station.
I marked with pleasure how his eye traveled over
me, and could barely suppress a smile. I had no
mind to bring about further trouble, but in spite of
good intention he took the visit ill; the malice he
bore me and the hatred I bore him so filled his spirit
and mine that there was no place in either for admiration
of the prowess of the other.</p>

<p>“So, sir,” said he, “you must seek to humiliate
me further.”</p>

<p>“I make offense to no man, save that of his own
choosing,” I replied. “I come upon the matter
of your exchange and liberation. In a short
time I go ashore to settle the terms of your
release; so we shall be quits. To-night you
may go as you will without hindrance from my
people.”</p>

<p>“I shall not leave you sadly, Sir Englishman,”
growled he. “But mark you this,—I am no weakling
enemy. You have bested me fairly, but for it
all I like you not. I hate you for your handsome
face, your sneaking air and your saintly mien. There
has been an account opened that cannot be closed
until one of us is dead. I will not die yet. One
day you shall fawn at my feet for mercy until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
fetters gnaw deep into your hide or the fire eats out
your heretic heart!”</p>

<p>They were ill-omened threats. His manner was
in no way to be mistaken and I was in no humor to
be crossed by such as he. But seeing no good to
come of further conversation I turned upon my
heel and walked to the companion-way.</p>

<p>“I warn you now,” he went on as I paused at the
foot of the hatch, “nothing in France can save
the Sieur de la Notte—nothing—not even in Dieppe.
I will seek you fair and I will seek you foul; I will
take you fair if fairness offers; but, fair or foul, I
will meet you when the advantage will not be upon
your side—and so, good-by,—Sir Pirato!” I heard
him laughing hoarsely as I walked up the gangway.
Surely he was not a pleasant person.</p>

<p>By six o’clock in the evening my arrangements
with Captain Hooper’s agent were made. In the
settlement the Spanish prisoners were to be exchanged
for certain Englishmen and Frenchmen, in
all thirty in number. A purchaser found, the <i>San
Cristobal</i> was to be sold forthwith, her equivalent in
gold being transferred to me for Captain Hooper at
Portsmouth. It gave me great disappointment that
there was no authorized agent of Admiral Coligny in
the town, to whom I could turn over in bulk the
money in the closet in the cabin. The condition of
affairs being so uncertain and men so little to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
trusted, there seemed no other way but to carry this
money to Coligny myself. Accordingly I also made
arrangements through the agent to have this great
treasure converted into jewels that I might convey
it the more easily. My own seamen, save Goddard
and Salvation Smith whom I retained, were to be
set upon a ship sailing for Portsmouth in a few days.
The Sieur de la Notte and his family were safely
removed to rooms in the house of a Huguenot,
who could be trusted to keep counsel; for in
Dieppe, though the followers of Calvin had assembled
in great numbers, there was even now danger
for noble fugitives. In the present condition of
matters of state, the Admiral, whose watchful eye
seemed to reach all France, might do nothing except
by subterfuge for his people; and there were many
at court who bore La Notte so fierce a hatred that
the aid of Coligny was now impossible. The house
in which the unfortunate nobleman was quartered
lay in the Rue Etienne under the shadow of the new
church of Saint Remi. The city, topped by the
frowning hill and battlements of the great Château,
lay thickly to the left; and down several turnings
to the right through the marts of the city was the
quay where the tall ships of the house of Parmentier
had for two generations brought in, each twelvemonth,
the richest products of the East.</p>

<p>Thither, on the following evening, after my visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to the shipping agent, I directed my steps. Although
I had a great treasure about me in jewels and
money, I was at a loss for a safer place and felt that
I might rest secure there until the morrow, when a
Protestant vessel would be sailing for the Seine.
I was going to leave Mademoiselle and my heart
was heavy. Diego de Baçan was loose in Dieppe,
and though at a disadvantage, I did not doubt
he would waste no time in learning the whereabouts
of every sympathizer in the town. Aye, and
every bravo of his creed who could be hired to do
his dirty work. As a matter of precaution there
came with me Job Goddard and Salvation Smith
who swung gleefully up from the counting-house
and landing place, buffeting aside the staid townsmen
and the seamen who were setting the supplies
upon the vessels of the fleet of Jean Ribault which
were to sail in a few days to establish the colony in
America.</p>

<p>Goddard and Smith I sent into a tavern near by
the abode of the Sieur de la Notte with instructions
to engage no one in conversation and to await my
coming. With the strongest admonitions to secrecy,
I had told them of the jewels about me, of
my plans and of my suspicions; for I wished, if
anything happened to me, that the Sieur de la Notte
should be informed. I knew these seamen devoted
to my interests; and the desire to aid me, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
fancied, had found no cause for abatement since
the struggle of the evening before with the Spaniard.</p>

<p>Of the things which happened in the cabaret and
of which I am about to tell, I afterward learned
from Goddard himself, whose resolution was a thing
of paper or of iron as he was in or out of his cups.
He differed from Salvation Smith, for there was no
hour, drunk or sober, in which that stalwart Christian
would not vigorously assail the strongholds of
the devil. There seemed to be no tenet of the New
Religion which he had not at his tongue’s obedience;
and when he and Goddard were drunk together, the
exhortations of Salvation would reach a degree of
frenzy which for the time silenced even the profanity
of his companion. Quiet of common, his talk would
then become louder and more forward until there
was at last no opportunity for talk from others.
And as his speech grew louder, that of Goddard, the
blasphemer, would become more subdued, until, for
a time perhaps, but few words—none of them of
saintly origin—came from his lips. The torrent of
the discourse of Smith, halted for a moment, gained
by delay a stronger flow and burst forth the more
sturdily, until burnt up at last in the flame of its own
enthusiasm. Yet Job Goddard would not be denied
for long, and so ingenious were his powers that his
mutterings would at last resolve themselves into combinations
of words so new and surprising that Salvation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Smith even was soon agape with something very
near to admiration.</p>

<p>Much of this must have happened after I left
them. In the hostel was a crowd of seamen and
broken down gentlemen. The swords of these cavaliers
were their only fortune, and they were about to
sail on the voyage with the Huguenot Ribault to
Florida. Many of them, as will be seen, I came to
know and so learned from them also of the things
set forth hereafter. They were for the most part of
a religious inclination, though not a few had no more
religion in their hearts than Goddard. They were
all reckless, and in one last drinking bout were taking
leave of home and France. The alicant had passed
but half a dozen times and Goddard had sat patiently
through a discourse from his companion upon the
lives of the martyrs until his flesh and blood could
stand it no longer. He lifted his pot and in a tone
of lusty confidence which might easily have been
heard from one end of the room to the other said,
grinning broadly,</p>

<p>“Bad eatin’ and drinkin’ to the Spanish, Jem
Smith! Uneasy sleepin’ and wakin’ for King Philip!
A cross-buttock and a broken head for Dyago! And
a good fight at the last for our pains! Drain it, lad,—you’ll
never have a better.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” said Salvation, piously. “And thanks
for the victory of the <i>Griffin</i>, Job Goddard. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
was never surer mark of His handiwork than yonder
cruise when the righteous were uplifted and confusion
came to the enemies of His Gospels.”</p>

<p>“Amen again,” said Goddard, “and be damned
to them!” He rose to his feet and looking around
him clattered his pot loudly against the table.</p>

<p>“Look ye, lads, an ye like not barleycorn, a pot
of sack against the chill of the night! An’ if ye cannot
drink in English, I’ll warrant your French throats
no less slippery from frog eatin’.”</p>

<p>“Morbleu, non,” said one, “I am as dry as the
main yard of the <i>Trinity</i>.”</p>

<p>“To the <i>Great Griffin</i>, then,” said Goddard loudly,
“an’ the good crowns the <i>San Cristobal</i> sells for,
with some for Bess and some for we! Look you!
See how they glitter—less bright for the black head
on ’em, but welcome enough in the taproom—where
with a whole heart we can drink confusion to the
Spanish king and every other sneaking cat of a——”</p>

<p>“Sh—” said Smith in a low voice. He had just
reason enough to know that they were disobeying
orders. “For the love o’ God stow your gaff, lad,
there are like as not some of the thumb-screwing
whelps even here.” But the crowd of seamen were
amused at the Englishman and would not be denied.
They set their flagons down with a clatter to hear
Job Goddard, with the help of one of their number,
in a bluff, hearty way tell of the taking of the <i>San</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<i>Cristobal</i>. The story was strangely interlarded with
oaths and devout expressions, half French, half English,
but all bearing the mark of approval among the
Huguenot company, who did me the honor to rattle
their pots again right merrily at the account of my
wrestling bout with the Spaniard.</p>

<p>Salvation Smith, enjoying in his own way the importance
of his friend and ally, who for once had
drowned out his own eloquence, cast aside all
caution and sought to enhance the effect of Job’s
remarks by frequent and timely expressions of approval.
He walked about, smiling broadly, causing
the pots to be filled as often as they fell half empty.</p>

<p>So intent was the crowd upon the performance of
the seaman Goddard and so wrapped up in their
drinking bouts that they failed to notice three men
who sat at a corner table sipping at their liquor.
All three listened intently to Goddard’s tale and
once or twice looks of surprise passed between them.
As it went on they lifted their pots to hide their
lips and leaned well forward, whispering together,
then listening to catch the words of the seaman, as
his tongue, unloosed, swung merrily in the wind of
anecdote.</p>

<p>After a while when he paused for a moment there
was a commotion in another part of the room. A
slender spark of the company of Ribault, with a
well-worn doublet, but wearing a silver ear-ring, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
nicely trimmed beard and other marks of gentle
taste, was hoisted upon his legs and sang unsteadily
a verse which in English goes somewhat like
this:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here’s to every merry lass—<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here’s to her who’s shy, sirs,—<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here’s an overflowing glass<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To any roguish eye, sirs;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be she sweet or be she scold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be her temper warm or cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be she tall or be she small,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Naught can we but love her.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A-dieu—a-dieu—<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A-dieu, belle Marie-e!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Be she stout or be she lean—<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be she pauper, be she queen—<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be she fine or be she jade—<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be she wife or be she maid—<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here’s a toast to woman;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here’s a health to woman!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A-dieu—A-dieu—<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Adieu, belle Marie-e!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last two lines he sang in a melancholy drawl,
holding his pot up and looking at it with one eye
shut. This caused much applause and loud clapping.
To this he tried to respond with more spirit,
with a song and chorus which they afterwards sang
frequently upon the ships. It was very fine and had
a martial ring.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">“I drink my wine<br /></span>
<span class="i8">While others pine,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<span class="i8">And toast a lady fair—<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Chorus: And toast a lady fair!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">And to the eyes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Chorus: In Catharine’s vintage rare!<br /></span>

<span class="i8">To keep his blade in fettle<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Chorus: To keep his blade in fettle!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the refrain had died away and the Frenchman
had dropped back upon his bench, Goddard,
in a fine spirit of amity, jumped again to his feet,
trying to sing. He had no more notion of tune than
an anchor stock, but roared in an ear-splitting way:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Then fill a rousing cup wi’ me,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For there be naught to pay!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And drink to wee-man as she be<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From France to far Cathay!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He had reached a state of mind in which he
cared little enough for king, priest, or the devil, and
Salvation was in little better part, striving to preach a
sermon in French, of which language he had no notion
whatever. In the middle of his salty verse, Goddard
was set upon by several of the younger men and
lifted bodily upon the table. There he stood for a
moment swaying awkwardly from one foot to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
other, blinking at the light which swung to the rafters
a foot from his nose.</p>

<p>Then he shouted,</p>

<p>“Mounseers, my voice is like the run of the topsail
haulyard pollys. I can’t sing—an’—blood an’
ouns!—I won’t sing.”</p>

<p>“Par la mort! try it again, try it, mon ami!”</p>

<p>“Non, mounseers,—but by the sakrey blue, I can
keep a-givin’ ye healths so long as ye can stand—or
sit—for the matter o’ that.”</p>

<p>“Bigre! It seems true that this sailor-man has
a paunch like the great water duct of St. Michel.
But give us your toast. What is it, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, speak out, mon brave, some of us will understand
you—diable n’importe! What is it?”</p>

<p>“Ye can comprenay or not, but—odds bobs!—Nay,
Jem, I’ll say what I like. There may be traitors
among us; but, ventre blue! I’m a free sailor
of Queen Bess and fear no scut of a Spaniard as
ever twisted a thumb-screw. The marrow-bones o’
the best ha’ kissed the dust this many a time. An’
will again for English an’ French, from this to Floridy
an’ back agin.”</p>

<p>Some of the more timid in the crowd looked
around half-fearfully and a warning “Sh!” came
from the throats of some.</p>

<p>But Goddard was not to be daunted. He took a
swig from his pot and raised his voice,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye’ve started me now an’ hear me out, ye shall,
ye maidens ye! To hell with Philip! I’ll tell ye
why. Because there is money to be got in Spanish
ships. One day soon Jem an’ me will sprinkle,
not—hic—coppers, but <em>gold</em>, lads! Why, the <i>San
Cristobal</i> had more gold than ye’ll find this side o’
Hesper-hades, with all ye’r talk o’ Floridy. The
devil a better berth do we want than the <i>Griffin</i>.
Master Davy Devil—hic—can smell the gold
ten leagues at sea. An’ so, here’s that every—French—hic—captain
may have the luck of Davy
Devil!”</p>

<p>Here a whisp of a youth got up, drunk and quarrelsome.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, the sailor,” he said, “you speak—much
of gold. You have—hic—captured many ships.
Why therefore do we drink s-sack?”</p>

<p>Goddard put his hands to his hips and glared
down at the boy. First his brows met and he did
not know what to say. Then, as the humor struck
him, he burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>“We drink sack because ’tis good for the entrails
of hairy men. An’ till you grow a beard, me son,
’tis plain enough suet should do for you. But, ’twas
a fair question. We drink—hic—sack because we
have no gold. But wait! Wait all of ye another
day or so an’ I promise the rarest in France to run
down ye’re throats. Why, lads,—hic—Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Sydney Killigrew hath upon his person in jewels the
finest—hic—belt o’ treasure in all France, that——”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked drunkenly from one to
another. He was dumb with horror at having told
the secret of Coligny’s treasure. His hands fell to
his sides and the pot dropped to the table and floor,
breaking another as it fell. Then something flew
through the air crashing into the light and Goddard
fell to the floor. There was a skurry for the door
and the strange men who had sat in the corner
slipped out into the night and went running down
the street as fast as their legs could carry them.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<small>IN WHICH I LEARN SOMETHING.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Confusion reigned at the house in the Rue
Etienne. The Sieur de la Notte, sick at
heart and searching peace for Madame, had set
his mind upon going with Admiral Ribault to
Florida, in hope of escaping the persecution of those
who hated him at the French court. For my part,
since I had yet to perform my duty to the men who
employed me and must find Admiral Coligny at
Paris, it mattered little whether Mademoiselle were
in France or Florida. I would probably not see
her again in any event. Yet I could not forbear
asking to speak with her before the ships sailed
away.</p>

<p>When I reached the house she was with Madame
and could have but a word with me. She was, I
thought, a little haughty; but none the less, she
graciously promised me an hour in the morning. So
I stopped below for two hours or more with the
Sieur de la Notte, telling him of my plans and arranging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that I might have, through Ribault, two companions
under arms, to go with me and my sailors
to Paris. I also helped him in the disposition of
some of his own affairs, so that it was near midnight
when I left the house. I went straightway to the
hostel where I had left my seamen.</p>

<p>An account of the conduct of Smith and Goddard
at the hostel did not reach my ears until many days
afterwards when leagues at sea, with their consciences
purged and their minds cleared by the strife
of winds and seas, they came to me and told me
what had happened.</p>

<p>As it was, when I reached the door, the place was
reeking with the fumes of spilled liquor and prone
upon the floor lay Salvation Smith. Half across a
bench with a cut over his pate was Goddard, snoring
and swearing by turns. The keeper of the place, a
small, fat, greasy person, moved from the one to the
other, using all his arts to persuade them to leave
the place, with a frequent threat of calling the watch,
vowing that the town council would be upon him
and that the good repute of his house was gone forever.
Whenever he came near the one or the other,
there would be an outburst of maudlin oaths from
Goddard, who still held by the handle a drinking
pot, and made a play to strike with it at the Frenchman
as he approached.</p>

<p>I was in no mood to look upon the offense of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
henchmen lightly. I knew not what indiscretion
they might have committed, and bearing about me
the jewels I had received that day, I had no humor
to stay longer in so public a place where an unlucky
accident might rid me of both my money and friends,
to say nothing of employment. Yet I could not
leave them in this plight, for if found they must
surely have been known by De Baçan and his friends
and ill treated, if not done away with. I first kicked
Smith, who seemed the least drunk, and then Goddard;
bringing them both at last to a sullen sitting
posture, to the great joy of mine host, who saw at
last a chance of being rid of his troublesome guests.
When they saw it was I, they sobered for the moment,
and by shaking them and dashing water in their faces
I got them in some sort out of the door—to have it
speedily shut to and barred behind us.</p>

<p>They were drunk as flying-fish and went reeling
from one side of the street to the other, Goddard at
last coming against a wall headforemost, so that he
fell in a heap and would move no more. Smith had
revived in the air and was fairly well set upon his
legs. But he stood by my side as I tried to lift his
friend, looking first at the ground and then at the
stars, saying foolishly many times over, “God help
us! What have I done!” to the end that I thought
he had lost his wits altogether. I questioned him
and bade him help me, but he stood there looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
like the fool that he was and offering no hand in aid.
Tiring at last of his gibberish, I fetched him a
cuff upon the head which brought him up into the
wind. And between us we got Job Goddard again
upon his feet.</p>

<p>The street now took a sharp turn down past
the Church of Saint Jacques and into a portion
of the town I had not entered before. The way
was very dark, the gloom being lightened but little
by the fluttering glimmer of a rush-light here
and there behind some half-closed shutter. The
streets were deserted, no sign of guards or soldiers
being heard or seen. We made no little commotion
as we shuffled down toward the port, for Smith
was staggering from this side to that and Goddard
lay upon my shoulder a dead weight, his feet scraping
along upon the cobblestones as we went! His
arm was around my back and neck and this may
have prevented my hearing the sound of footsteps
behind us.</p>

<p>For, of a sudden, there flew past my head a
stone the size of my two fists, which went against
a wall hard by and broke into a hundred pieces. I
turned just in time to note the bulk of a man pitching
upon me in the starlight. He had me well off
my guard and caught me sidewise, so that I tripped
upon Goddard and we three went to the ground in
one snarling, struggling mass, kicking and rolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
about upon the pavement, he first uppermost and
then I.</p>

<p>There were others too, for I saw Smith strike out
and then go down with his man, struggling fiercely.
I had no wish to draw a weapon, for I still thought
them but common thieves and felt I might protect
myself. But my opinion of my ability was
to be my undoing, as it has often been. At last
I shook myself free of this fellow upon the ground
and got upon one knee, when I saw two others with
bludgeons dancing about and aiming at my head.
Twice, thrice, did I catch stinging blows upon my
arms and wrists which were like to have broken
them, when another more strongly dealt than the
others, caught me full upon the bare head and I
knew no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It seemed hours, days and then weeks that I lay
in a hideous dream in which I knew not whether I
lived or was dead. I fancied I heard the voice of
Mademoiselle speaking to me and then there would
come the menacing laugh of Diego de Baçan. I
dimly saw flickering lights and felt the presence of
people about me, but there was such a ringing in
my ears that I could hear nothing. By and by my
brain was less clouded and I had a mind to open
my eyes. With the coming of consciousness there
was a great pain in my head, which from numbness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
turned to burning and caused much anguish. But
I could now hear the sound of voices and I knew it
was no dream, so I gave no sign. Faintly I made
out a row of brown ceiling rafters, which seemed
to float here and there in a moving haze. I saw
uncertainly the wooden floor upon which I lay
stretched stark as one dead, and then discerned a
table at which sat several persons. A light burned
upon it, casting, as it flickered, great shadows
which moved unsteadily from wall to rafter and back
again. As I began to see clearly I made out one of
the men to be a priest. His cowl was pushed back
from his face and he listened to the man opposite
him, who was talking.</p>

<p>This man was bent forward over a parchment on
the table and he read portions of it to his companions.
He had a high forehead and an imperious
air which carried weight with the others. But his
face was hard and cruel, and his mouth and nose at
the corners wore deep and ugly lines which looked to
have been seared in with an iron. When he smiled it
was as though he twisted his features unwillingly,
so unnatural did it seem. I marked all these things
as one sometimes will in moments of great tension.
I had good reason afterwards to learn that my judgment
was true. He was Pedro Menendez de Avilés,
the hardest man in all the Spanish marine, now but
just appointed Adelantado of the Floridas. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
face of the third man was turned away from me.
He was a big man and his shadow fell over me so
that I could make him out the more clearly. There
was no mistaking the easy set of the head and
shoulders as he lolled upon his chair, or the grace of
his limbs and body. He had not spoken; but I
knew it was De Baçan.</p>

<p>This for the first time brought me to my wits. I
knew not how long I had lain or where I was. It
was enough that I was in the hands of this Spaniard
and that my girdle of jewels and gold was stolen.
It tried me sorely to think at all, and with Mademoiselle
gone I hardly cared what might happen.
But I knew that my chance of escape, had I any,
lay in making them believe me still unconscious and
done almost to death. So I lay quite still with my
eyes half closed, fearing almost to breathe, and
straining my ears to catch every word of their talk,
which, carried on in French, now came to my ears
quite clearly.</p>

<p>“These Huguenots, you say, father, will go to
the River of May?” asked De Avilés.</p>

<p>“It is so reported in the town. They will sail in
seven small ships and will muster three hundred
men, with some women and many artisans bearing
everything necessary to form this colony.”</p>

<p>“And the colony of Laudonnière, what of that?”</p>

<p>“Word has been received that there is mutiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
against the Commander Laudonnière,—who is accused
of many misdemeanors by those who have
returned. I am bidden tell you, by those who are
close in our councils at Paris, that you need fear
nothing from them.”</p>

<p>“But they have a fort and are well provided with
munitions of war,—we may not be able to strike
them separately. If they combine forces they may
even be too much for us; for heretics though they
be these Huguenots are still very excellent fighters.”</p>

<p>“Your Excellency knows best the qualities of good
men-at-arms. The Adelantado of Florida must not
be defeated. Though you and your people be Spaniards,
they are still Catholics and firm in the Christian
faith. It is a sainted war which you are waging
and when you strike, the hand of God will be with
you. Therefore, I say, have no fear. For those who
have sent me to you know what they know when
they pray the Holy Virgin for your success.”</p>

<p>I could hardly believe what I heard. Were there
bigots so base that they would destroy their own
people and their own nation? And Mademoiselle
had gone with the Huguenots! I grew weak again
and trembled from head to foot as one with an ague.</p>

<p>De Baçan began speaking now and I nerved myself
to listen.</p>

<p>“Your Excellency needs no information of mine
upon the designs of these French people in the territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of Spain. They will lose no time in setting
with fine skill upon the ignorant minds of the savage
peoples of those parts who otherwise may yet be
saved. Yet your Excellency should take no chances
of defeat.”</p>

<p>Menendez was stroking his mustache. His eyes
glittered strangely.</p>

<p>“What would you advise, father?” he said.</p>

<p>“There is no way to stop or even delay this
Ribault,” said the Jesuit. “There remains but to
petition the King to increase your force. ’Tis an
expedition,” he laughed, “which is as good for the
soul as the purse and the body, and there will be
many to profit by it. But a few hundred more men
and three or four more ships will make you as secure
in your possessions as the most Catholic King himself
in his throne and his people.”</p>

<p>“There is much that is wise in what you say,”
said the Adelantado, “but the King has no money
for this enterprise. The money which I have
secured has come from my own people of the Asturias,
and I know not whither to go for more.”</p>

<p>De Baçan here arose from his seat and walked
cautiously to the door and window. I lay as one
dead, holding my breath in fear lest I should be discovered.
He came and bent over me for a moment.
It seemed an eternity, and I felt the look of his eyes
as they pierced me through and through. He seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
satisfied with the scrutiny, for he went back to the
table; putting both hands upon it, he leaned far
over toward the Adelantado.</p>

<p>“What would your Excellency do for one who
could find this money?” he said.</p>

<p>Menendez looked up, smiling his strange smile.</p>

<p>“You are eager, my friend,” he replied calmly.
“It might be worth much or little,—perhaps a
share of my profits—perhaps—nothing. But what
do you know?”</p>

<p>“It is for this I wished to see your Excellency.”
He paused. “I have managed an affair of no
small profit,” he laughed, “and I am no glutton.”</p>

<p>Unfastening his doublet he unwrapped from
around his body the treasure of Coligny, and tossed
it upon the table. “There is enough for a thousand
men and more,” he said.</p>

<p>The Adelantado undid the leather bands gravely,
while the eyes of the priest started almost out of
their sockets as the glittering stones tumbled out
upon the table. The Adelantado uttered an exclamation
and the three of them sat there silent for a
moment, with their eyes shining like the wonderful
stones they looked upon.</p>

<p>The priest was the first to speak. “A thousand
men, surely!” he said.</p>

<p>Then the Adelantado ran the jewels through his
fingers. He gloated over them fiercely, for in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
glittering faces of those little baubles he saw before
him the scenes of blood and persecution which were
to come. He saw himself master of all the great
domain that had been allotted to him and he
dreamed of conquests and treasures such as no man
had won since the beginning of the world.</p>

<p>He raised his head at last. “You have done well,
De Baçan,” he said. “You have done well, my son.
You shall be my Captain of Camp. We will reach
an agreement upon your duties and profits without
difficulty. These jewels shall go with me to the
Biscayan ports and we will have a fleet and company
of men great enough to take the islands of Elizabeth
if need be. We will have galleons of a thousand
tons, the tallest that float and——”</p>

<p>“But your Excellency cannot fail,” interposed
the priest, who had been eying him narrowly, “to
give some tribute to the Church—some tribute for
your safety?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father. But for the present, as you can see,
we will need all of this treasure to prepare for our
journey, which indeed is as much for God as for the
King.”</p>

<p>The Jesuit pulled the cowl up over his head and
turned upon De Baçan fiercely.</p>

<p>“You have told me, Diego de Baçan, that you
have done this hulking English heretic to death for
the profit of your soul and the glory of the Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
In this you have lied,—I know now that he was set
upon because of a private quarrel. It is plain you
have taken him and his money unfairly. You
become a servant of the Evil One, a thief and
murderer, and should suffer the penalty of the
Church.”</p>

<p>Both Diego and Menendez arose, uncovered their
heads, and crossed themselves. Then the Adelantado
leaned over and picked up three large stones.
These he extended to the priest. The cleric lowered
his head to conceal his cupidity; but took
the jewels quickly, putting them inside his gown,
mumbling the while some Latin words to himself.
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Absolvo te</i>, my son,” he said.</p>

<p>Then De Baçan put the rest of the jewels back in
the girdle and fastened it about him.</p>

<p>“This Englishman was a most comfortable prize,”
he laughed. “It was a little quarrel of my own, father.
I confess it, yonder Englishman has caused me great
trouble since the taking of the <i>Cristobal</i>. There is
a lady and—well,—he was forever balking me and I
hated him. But faugh! to-morrow he will be dead
and there is an end of the matter.” The three of
them came over to me and De Avilés fetched me a
kick in the ribs. Had it been Diego, I must have
groaned outright, for De Baçan did nothing lightly.
But I lay quiet, and aided by the darkness escaped
notice. They took the light and went out through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the iron door, locking it behind them, and I heard
their laughter and jesting as they went down the
hallway and so out through a gate which must have
been at the end of the passage.</p>

<p>The sound of their footsteps had not died away
before I was upon my hands and knees groping my
way toward the window, through which stole a dusky
light. It was not until then that I discovered how
weak I was. My shirt and doublet were dank with
blood, for my head had been sadly cut; and my
neck was so stiff I could scarce turn my head from
the one side to the other. I got up with difficulty,
but my head swam and I fell heavily to the floor
again. The room seemed to be pitching from this
side to that and the square of light where the window
was swayed to and fro, sickening me at last
so that I lay still until I might gather resolution
and not again overdo my strength. My mind was
chaos. What had become of Goddard and Smith,
and how long had I been in this place? I knew
not—nor for a time seemed much to care. With
the weakness there came a feeling of indifference
and I was content to lie there, with no thought
for anything. But presently the faintness passed
and I began trying to unravel the skein of my
thoughts.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle had sailed with the expedition of Admiral
Ribault,—and yet the Jesuit had said they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
sail on the morrow. They had then been delayed,—or
else—yes, it must be—the night of the robbery
had not yet passed away. And with that I grew
more collected. Perhaps there was yet time to see
the Sieur de la Notte and the Admiral Ribault, and
warn them of this plot of the Catholics, the secret
of which had come into my possession. The Catholics
of Spain would destroy the Huguenot colony
and certain Catholics of France had connived at the
villainy. That was a great secret of State and surely
one to make the blood of any honest Frenchman,
whether Catholic or Calvinist, boil with shame and
anger.</p>

<p>Then, when I thought that it was through my loss
of the treasure of Coligny that this thing had come
to be possible, I was in great turmoil of spirit and
clinched my jaws fiercely as I searched in mind for
some plan to redeem myself. I tried to rise and at
last got upon my feet with a great effort, and to the
table, where I limply hung. And Captain Hooper!
What would he say when I went to him? I had no
heart to think of it—I knew him well. He would
ask me why was I there to tell him of it? Yes,
truly, I was out of employment. Fortune had smiled
too favorably upon me to smile for long.</p>

<p>I sat swaying there, trying to gather strength to
break out of this vile place, when I heard the sound
of whispering close at hand; but whether it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
from inside or out I could not tell. If it were De
Baçan, I resolved to dash upon him with a chair and
so, if I could stay upon my feet, perhaps gain the
outer door. I listened for a moment and then heard
plainly that it came from outside the window. I
crouched down below the jamb listening intently.
Then to my great joy there came a low whistle in
exact counterfeit of a call upon the <i>Great Griffin</i>.</p>

<p>My friends had not forgotten me then!</p>

<p>My joy was so great I could scarce refrain from
shouting. But I found I could not even if I would.
I managed so to answer that they heard my whistle,
for there came an exclamation and a bulky shape
appeared at the bars of the window.</p>

<p>“Master Sydney, sir, are ye safe?” came in a half
whisper, and there was a world of comfort in the
voice. It was Smith! And I reassured him in a
moment; then managing to get the table over under
the window, mounted upon it and found my head
and shoulders just abreast of the sill. There were
heavy bars of iron before the window, but rough
and rusty to the touch. So Smith brought a piece
of timber, which he used as a pry, and with help
managed to snap and then bend a bar so that I
could let them haul me up and out through the narrow
opening. But my strength had been sorely tried
and so it was some moments before I could stand
upright and look about me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>It was but a short time before the dawn. The Sieur
de la Notte upheld me on one side and on the
other was a tall man whom I knew not. He had a
beard reaching to his waist and gave several brisk
orders; I afterwards learned it was Admiral Jean
Ribault. Several men went about the building,
knocking and seeking to discover if there were any
one within; but the Admiral called them back, bidding
them be quiet. Withal, being very weak, by great
effort I managed to tell them of the Catholic plot
and that the Spaniards would doubtless soon return
and it might be possible to recover the treasure.</p>

<p>This was as important for Ribault as it was for
me, for it meant much to the Lutheran cause.
But he would not have it so, saying Menendez
was well upon his way and letting me know, in
a sad way which I liked not in one of so fine a bearing,
that it would be unwise to foment trouble. He
believed in his strength and ability to hold the land
of Florida against all nations; he wished only to
depart without molestation or hindrance. Of a
truth, I was so sick and weak that I knew not what
they did. My effort of mind had been too great,
for now that I was safe and had told my story, it
grew weaker and I could not think. They half
led, half carried me, to the Rue Etienne and there
put me to bed.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />
<small>IN WHICH I FIND NEW EMPLOYMENT.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">I awoke the next morning to find Mademoiselle
standing by my bedside with a potion which
she bade me take. In a short while there came a
chirurgeon who looked at my head, bathing and bandaging
it, to the end that in an hour or so I felt so
much better that I could sit upright and listen to
Mademoiselle as she told me of their plans. Surely
no medicine were so good for mind or body as the
sight of her as she moved here and there about the
room; and when she brought me my draught and
leaned over to give it me, I found myself holding
the cup to my lips without swallowing, taking my
cure not through my lips but through my eyes.</p>

<p>Then says she,</p>

<p>“Nay, Master Sydney, you must drink it down.
It is not bitter.”</p>

<p>No, it was not bitter. I wished that I might be
always ill. But she was not impatient. She looked
upon me with the eyes of friendliness and interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
What there was of coldness had disappeared from
her manner; for the fancies of such as she are engulfed
always in the instincts of womanhood. She
put her hand upon my wrist, with fine hardihood
counting the beatings of my pulse, her eyes cast
upon a minute-glass. Then she smiled as she found
that the fever was less, though for my part, from
the thumping of my heart, I could not see that I
was in any better case than I should be.</p>

<p>I had murmured but a word of thanks—telling
her that I was better. Thus far I was content to
say nothing so long as she would only stay where
I might look at her. She, herself, was balm to my
wounds. But when she was about to leave the
room to tell her father that I had awakened, I called
to her.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, just a word. It is hard to say the
words of gratitude I would. I am but a yeoman of
Queen Bess, a sea-rover if you like. I am without
friends save yourselves, and without either money
or employment. In a few days or perhaps hours
you too will be gone. I shall never see you again.”
I paused. “Otherwise I should not speak.”</p>

<p>She looked at me curiously and then moved as
though to go, but I made a gesture which held her.
I knew not what had come over me. The words
rushed upon my tongue and I could not restrain
them. I was rough and brutal in my frankness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
But then what mattered it? She was going to one
end of the world, and I to another; and I wished
only that she should know—that she should believe.</p>

<p>“Listen, Mademoiselle. I know that I am fit
only to serve and obey you. You are noble and
I—whatever claim I have—am but a loutish fellow.
Why I have the audacity to speak to you I do
not know, save that by kindness you have given me
that right. Listen you must. I love you, Mademoiselle,
I love you! That is all.”</p>

<p>She had stood facing the door, her hands before
her and her eyes cast down, quietly listening. But
as I went on her hands dropped to her sides, her
head lifted and her eyes, first mildly curious and
then indignant, flashed at me angrily.</p>

<p>“Stop, monsieur!” she said, and so haughtily that
the blood went back upon my heart. She was no
small woman, but to me, unworthy of her, she
seemed in her pride and majesty to add to her
stature half again. She turned red and white by
turns, while her lips seemed to be seeking the words
with which to deter me. Yet I could not have
stopped any more than I could have gone to find
Coligny’s treasure. When she spoke again, it was
with a coolness and precision, that chilled me to
the heart.</p>

<p>“Master Killigrew, however much we may have
been in your debt, you need make no doubt, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
are amply repaid. For shame, monsieur! To take
advantage of our pity and our friendliness! It were
not difficult to see you are better. Adieu, monsieur!”
And with this she opens the door and walks through
it, looking no more at me and bearing an expression
which I knew not, one in which pride and pity
seemed struggling for the mastery. When the door
had closed, I heard the sound of her feet running up
the stairs and then a door swung to with violence
overhead.</p>

<p>I was a great hulking brute, deserving but scant
consideration. I know not what it was that impelled
me to speak as I had done,—a hand-pressure
on the <i>Cristobal</i>, her sympathy in my affairs or
something in the look she gave me when she stood
over me with the physic. But unused to soft words,
I could no more have restrained myself than I could
the seas which plashed the bows of the <i>Griffin</i>.</p>

<p>As it was, when she left the room all the light went
out from life. I only knew I could not stay longer
in that house. If I had forfeited the right to her
friendship, then I must go and at once. I could not
bear it that she thought of me as she did. If she
told the Sieur de la Notte, as she doubtless would,
and I should lose his good opinion too, then surely
I should be undone. I was unlucky, and what was
worse, a fool into the bargain. Getting up slowly,
leaning against the wall, I managed to put upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
me my clothing and doublet. I did not know
where I was to go. I could not go to England.
Nor to Captain Hooper’s agent,—I was ruined, and
could picture the face of that oily Frenchman as
I told him the jewels were gone. It would be
serious for me. It meant prison, at the worst; at
the best, Captain Hooper’s disdain. Of the two,
however, I think I feared the former least. I would
go I cared not whither, back to the house where I
had been confined perhaps, to see if Diego de Baçan
might not return;—to Spain perhaps in pursuit of
Menendez. I knew not. At last I stumbled to the
door of the room and so out into the passage, and
had but laid my hand upon the bolts of the outer
door when there were footsteps in the hallway and
I turned my head to see Mademoiselle coming
toward me. Her eyes were cast down, but as she
came near she lifted her head and extended her
hand as one man might do to another, saying,</p>

<p>“Forgive me, my friend,—I did not mean it.”</p>

<p>I held out my hand stupidly, looking at her and
replying,</p>

<p>“Ah, Mademoiselle, I have no further mission in
this house.”</p>

<p>She clasped my hand strongly, leading me back
again into the room where I had lain. And there
was not strength to resist.</p>

<p>In a little while there came the Sieur de la Notte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to inquire for my health. He sat down beside me
and entered straightway upon the business he had
in mind.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking much of you, good Sydney,”
he began, “and have come to ask your plans.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, monsieur,” I replied as I
grasped his hand, “but I have no plans. If I cannot
replace or set finger upon the treasure which
was entrusted to me, I have no further hope of employment
from my sovereign; for she likes not men
who do not succeed. I shall wait here a few days,
when I will get upon the track of De Avilés, striving
to do by secrecy what I might not accomplish
by strength.”</p>

<p>La Notte shook his head.</p>

<p>“It will not do, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>,—it will not do. I
know it,—for the Admiral has just told me the state
of these affairs. The Catholics at the Court will
countenance this expedition and will hold Menendez
as safe in France as though he were in his own Asturias.
You may as well whistle for the jewels, Sydney,
for you will see them no more.”</p>

<p>I sighed deeply, for I felt that what he said was
true.</p>

<p>“You yourself have heard enough to convince you
that all matters at the French court are not as they
seem. You will not succeed in any private undertaking
against Spain,—sure of that you may be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
And, monsieur, you had better be bled by leeches
than by pike-heads for awhile. Listen to the Admiral’s
offer. We sail on the morrow for the land
of promise, good Sydney, three hundred strong, to
build up a great Christian nation across the ocean.
Ribault has bid me offer you a commission as lieutenant
aboard his flagship, for he is short-handed
in officers and needs those who have a knowledge
of ships; also he can employ any of your
men who have a taste for this venture in New
France.”</p>

<p>I saw that he was trying to conceal what he had
done for me, under plea of his own advantage. I
could say nothing, but extended my hand and he
pressed it warmly. Mademoiselle had been sitting
by listening until then. Now as I looked at her
for half a sign she got up and busied herself preparing
some medicine for Madame.</p>

<p>“Will you go, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>? If you like it not perhaps
you may return upon the vessels when they
come again to France.”</p>

<p>I was silent, looking still at Mademoiselle. This
time she turned and said quietly,</p>

<p>“It is a fine venture for a man of ingenuity and
daring.”</p>

<p>What could I do? Everything else vanished before
the thought that I was still in her favor and
that too in spite of what I had said to her. I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
voyage of a verity to the ends of the earth with no
further wish than to be near her.</p>

<p>I said that I would go, and saw no more of Mademoiselle
on that morning. When I got a glimpse
of her in the afternoon she but nodded her head,
speaking not at all and taking so little notice of
me, indeed, that I might have been but a serving
man.</p>

<p>I wrote a long letter to Captain Hooper, giving a
correct report of all that had happened upon the
<i>Cristobal</i> and in Dieppe. I told him of the condition
of affairs in France and how it was impossible
to recover what had been lost. I told him I
doubted not that these Spanish vessels would soon
set out for Florida, and that my chances for winning
back his esteem and any treasure or prize money
was better in Florida than in France. I wrote of
Fort Caroline, where the French would be found,
and saying that should he desire such a venture in
the <i>Griffin</i>, there would be honor and prizes in
plenty where the Spaniards put in. This I entrusted
through the Sieur de la Notte to the captain of
a vessel sailing for Portsmouth, who might be relied
upon to deliver it safely to the care of Martin Cockrem
at the Pelican.</p>

<p>That much done, I felt relieved in mind, and when
Admiral Ribault came late that night, could discuss
with him many details of the expedition. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
had then a chance to learn what manner of man I
was to serve.</p>

<p>He was tall and of a commanding presence. His
face was swarthy and marked by the crossing white
wrinkles of a man of the sea. His rather thin lips
were hid under a long moustache and his beard
reached quite down to his waist. His nose was big
and not ill formed, but it was in his eyes that one
noted the character of the man. These were gray-blue
and kindly. As he talked on, they flashed
keenly and one saw his power. It was not a strong
face,—nor a weak one, but it showed him as he
was, an able and gallant seaman and gentleman, loving
above all else his life, his Country and his God.</p>

<p>The next morning I awoke much refreshed, and
with the help of two lieutenants of Ribault, managed
in some sort to make my way down to the docks
and go to the <i>Trinity</i>, Ribault’s flagship, upon which
I had been given my commission. I was still very
weak and could expect to do no duty for awhile,
but the breath of the sea as it swept up into the dip
of land, sent fresh blood pulsing through my veins
and gave me a new interest in the people about me
with whose lives mine was to be mingled for many
months. The most of that day I spent upon the
vessel’s deck watching the final loading of stores and
learning the lead of the tackling. I could see the
six other vessels lying near us in the Arques, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
marked that but four of them were of any considerable
size; the others were small vessels of less
than half the tonnage of the <i>Griffin</i>, being sprung
high up in the stern, lacking her grace in run of line
and length and rake of mast. All of the ships were
well out of the water like the <i>Cristobal</i> and had a
great slant of after-castle, the topmost deck of
which sloped uncomfortably forward. But they
were staunch vessels for the country and time, and
with their armaments, which seemed very complete,
might be expected to make a good argument against
ships of the same metal.</p>

<p>But I liked little the temper of the company, which
to me seemed scarce suited to the kind of work before
us. The cavaliers came aboard in twos and
threes, many of them of somber mien and habit, but
mostly poor gentlemen who had but this resource
left to them. Some were gaily attired and I marked
a curled moustache here, an ear jewel there, or a
ruff in the latest twist of fashion.</p>

<p>Nor were the seamen the honest yeomen of England.
They worked willingly enough, but they
danced and jested among themselves, laughing and
singing foolish songs like lads of ten years or thereabouts.</p>

<p>“Body o’ me, sir,” said Goddard gruffly, “they’re
ladies, every scut of ’em! Blast me,—ye can’t make
a fightin’ crew out of men as won’t swear!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>I smiled and mentioned Salvation Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh well, he’s different, sir,” he answered. “’Tis
his principles, Master Sydney. That’s all’s the
matter with him. When he fights he’s a-cursin’ all
the time in his heart, I know,—he couldn’t fight,
else.”</p>

<p>With regard to the company of adventurers it
made me feel no better to learn that there was another
to share my opinion. It was no child’s play,
this voyage, on which we were going. It was work
for staunch-bodied men with big limbs and stiff
hands, and not the slender, pink-fingered gentlemen
I had seen thus far. When I thought that the safety
of Mademoiselle lay with the disposition of these
people I was more troubled than ever.</p>

<p>She came aboard late in the afternoon, and with
Madame and the Sieur de la Notte went at once to
the cabin. Soon Admiral Ribault came alongside
in his pinnace and signaled the fleet to get under
way. Amid the firing of cannon upon the shore
we passed out of the river on the ebb of the tide
and with a fair wind set the broad bows of the
<i>Trinity</i> squarely into the red path of light that
shimmered towards the sun, the color of blood. I
shuddered a little; then laughed aloud at my womanish
thought. Surely, my illness had made me
weak indeed.</p>

<p>In a few days Mademoiselle came upon the deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
with Madame. I had grown so strong that I was
taking my day watches now. My pulses tingled
anew and my lungs drank their fill of the salt air.
The old love of the life was in me again. But I could
not make out the manner of Mademoiselle de la
Notte. Twice in the first week did I go up to her
and address her, but I was so ill at ease and her
manner so distant that I turned away and sought
another part of the vessel. Then when she saw
that she had hurt me and that perhaps the difference
of our positions—she thinking me not to be of gentle
birth—had gone more deeply than she had wished,
she called me to her and bade me place a stool for
her and one for Madame and wrap them in their
cloaks, talking cheerfully the while. This I did
silently, going then forward to my place of duty. I
had no wish to force my presence upon her and so
kept at a distance, speaking only when it was not to
be avoided. And yet my heart was sore that she
should treat me so.</p>

<p>Then there would come two or three of those bejeweled
gentlemen; who, recovered from their sickness,
stood by her side talking to her gaily after the
manner of the sparks at a levee, flaunting their fine
scented handkerchiefs. This she seemed to enjoy,
and made my cup of bitterness full to overflowing.</p>

<p>But by and by there came a change. One day,
the third week from Dieppe, while I was talking between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
my watches with the sister of Lieutenant
Bachasse, Mademoiselle motioned that she would
speak with me. She dismissed those fine hangers-on
and asked me what she had done that I had treated
her in so ill a fashion. I said nothing; for it did not
become me to cavil. She knew well why I had not
waited upon her, and why I would not speak. I
seemed to see it in the way she spoke; and I learned
from that time what discernment a woman has upon
all matters which concern the heart of a man.
Things after that were better between us. By and
bye, no day passed that we did not talk together;
sometimes in presence of Madame or Monsieur the
Vicomte, and sometimes alone.</p>

<p>Oh, the wonder of those days and nights upon
the ocean! When the afternoon sun shimmered fair
upon the amber seas to the southward, and the sails
about us were picked out in silver against the purple
of the horizon, turning as the sun dropped down, to
ruddy gold and bronze and then fading away into
the gray softness of dusk! And then, when the
gulls and dolphins ceased to play and the moon
came out, we would sometimes lean upon the bulwarks,
just she and I, looking down along the sides
to the bow-wave where the fire of the southern
waters turned the gray of the foam to soft glowing
flames which warmly kissed the ship and then danced
away like sprites into the darkness beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is an ocean of velvet,—a fair ocean,” she would
say softly.</p>

<p>“It is Heaven, Mademoiselle,” I would answer.</p>

<p>We talked much of the things which had been and
of those to come, and I told her the stories of faraway
lands that I had seen. She wondered greatly
at some of the things I knew; and yet for all that
I felt at times as though I were but a child beside
her in every other thing save the mere buffets of
life. She was haughty no more; for it seemed in
that gray immensity of murmuring sea and starlit
sky that all was equal between us, and that we two
were alone, close to our Maker.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<small>WE REACH THE NEW LAND.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">After many days there came, one afternoon,
loud and cheery from the fore-mast head, the
cry of “Land! Land!” Only one who has been three
months upon an ocean, unfathomable and limitless,
can know the magic of the word. The signals passed
it to the other vessels of the fleet, trumpets blared and
cheer upon cheer and song upon song echoed and
re-echoed across the water. Crew and passengers
upon the <i>Trinity</i> came tumbling up from below,
jostling and crowding one another in their madness
to be among the first to get a glimpse of their home
that was to be. Even those sick with the scurvy
and fever turned out of their hammocks and, climbing
to the deck, fell upon their knees to thank God
that the voyage was near ended. All thought of
savage Carib or more savage Spaniard was banished,
for there to their gaze, shimmering purple under
the western sun, was their haven of refuge. They
stretched their limbs like people awaking from a long
sleep; and, as the ship glided onward, leaned forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
upon the bulwarks as though they would leap into
the water. They strained to catch the first aromatic
breath of the pines in their nostrils and their tongues
clove to their parched and fevered mouths as they
sighed for the fruits which hung there beyond, luscious
and ripe for their plucking.</p>

<p>By sundown we had sailed into a little river. Here
was a fine sandy bottom, and we cast anchor for the
night. So impatient were the seamen and passengers
that some of them, not to be withheld, took one of the
pinnaces and went upon the shore. Ribault, after
warning them against the savages, consented to this,
and soon the beach was aglow with fires which they
lighted to keep off wild beasts; and parties well
armed went searching among the uplands for fruit
and game. Throughout the night we upon ship-board
could hear the seamen and cavaliers as they
laughed and shouted. At daybreak they came
aboard again, torn and bleeding from the thorns
and brambles, but happy as urchins. They bore
several large panniers of luscious wild pomegranates
of a small variety, and grapes of great size and
sweetness.</p>

<p>But the Admiral would not tarry here long. He
did not know how soon the Spaniards might be
coming, and he wished to learn what had happened
in his absence to Laudonnière, the Commander at
Fort Caroline. Many things had been charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
against that officer and Ribault desired to establish
the French Protestants firmly in their colony, and
secure them speedily from attack or molestation.
Accordingly the ships weighed anchor again and we
sailed up the coast to the River of Dolphins. This
had been so called by Ribault because of the great
number of fish of that name which disported themselves
in its waters.</p>

<p>Seeing no sign of living persons we sailed still
further northward to the River of May, which we
reached on the 29th of August, 1565. The channel
of the river being narrow and the draught of the
large ships being great, we cast anchor at about half
a league from shore.</p>

<p>Ribault, anxious to communicate at once with
Laudonnière, immediately fitted out all the large
barges from the fleet and crowded crews into them,
fully armed and equipped. He knew not what might
have happened. I, being an officer upon the flagship,
went with him in the pinnace, and so we made
our way up the river.</p>

<p>At last we sighted a small headland or bluff which
rose abruptly from the water where the river narrowed,
and under its shadow we could just make out the
bastions of Fort Caroline. As we came near we saw
a great commotion upon the shore, officers running
out of the Fort brandishing their swords; and
two of the soldiers began casting loose a gun. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
we knew that they took us for enemies of France.
A soldier ran down the beach and fired an arquebus
at us, but the ball went skipping along the water
and did us no damage. The Admiral, seeing that
they did not know us and thinking harm might ensue,
hereupon stood up in the pinnace. We saw
one of the officers take off his morion and throw it
into the air with a shout of joy. Then there was
cheering, and we knew they had recognized the Admiral.
In a few moments, under the sturdy sweep
of the oarsmen, the barges grated upon the pebbly
beach and we tumbled out among those assembled
there. There was great joy among the young French
gentlemen, some of them running to the newcomers
and kissing them with great display of friendship
upon both cheeks. The cannon, which but a moment
before were to have been turned upon us, were fired in
salute and the air resounded with glad cries and
cheers.</p>

<p>There were many Indians of the tribe of the Chief
Satouriona upon the beach. Fine, straight-bodied
savages they were, painted in bright colors all over
the body and wearing only a breech-clout, and a
band around the head. They were most grave of
countenance and smiled little; but very friendly,
crowding around the Admiral, bowing and touching
their heads to the earth, marvelling at the great
length of his beard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>I could see that the Fort was erected in a careful
manner though sadly out of repair. It was built in
the form of a triangle and surrounded by a trench,
the side toward the river enclosed with a palisade of
planks of timber after the manner in which gabions
are made. In the middle was a great court eighteen
paces long and upon one side of this, the “corps de
garde.” Opposite to it, the living house. Laudonnière,
asked us to his lodging-place and gave us a
wine fermented from the grape of the country, most
soothing to the palate and livening to the vitals.</p>

<p>Under the close questioning of the Admiral,
Laudonnière related the events of the past few
months, showing the sad straits into which his people
had fallen for lack of food and munitions. He told
of the mutiny of his men and how he had intended
entering two of his smaller vessels and returning to
France. The Admiral found that the charges against
him were untrue, and offered him a high command.
But Captain Laudonnière was disconsolate, saying
that his honor had been touched and that he must
soon return to France to defend himself against his
enemies.</p>

<p>We talked far into the night, Vasseur, Verdier and
De Brésac, three lieutenants of the garrison with
whom I had much talk, giving me a fair good idea
of the country and people. It seemed that Laudonnière
had no need to have given up so easily. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was hard to see how, in a country abounding in
animals good to eat, in fish and in fruit and corn,
they should have been reduced to such distress as
they were in. There are beasts of every kind, and
Sir John Hawkins has said that there are lions and
tigers as well as unicorns, but I saw none of these,
though there were crocodiles in great abundance.</p>

<p>Vasseur told me a habit of the natives who when
they travel have a kind of herb dried, which they
put in an earthen cup and set a-fire. Then they
suck the smoke of this through a cane or reed and it
has a strange and pleasing effect, satisfying their
hunger so that they can live four or five days without
meat or drink. Some of the company had come
to use this herb and had grown to like it well, though
at first it made them much inward discomfort. All
of these things are known in England now, for Sir
Walter Raleigh hath brought this custom of tobacco
smoking into the court.</p>

<p>In the morning the three smaller vessels of the
fleet came up, bringing the greater number of the
colonists, among them the Sieur de la Notte and his
family, and by the end of the day the rest had landed.
Rude sheds of cedar stripping were built and a tolerable
sheltered place was thus made to house the men
until better quarters should be provided. During
the first nights the women were given the barracks
of the company of Laudonnière, who, for the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
being, shared the lot of the newcomers. For Mistress
Diane de la Notte nothing was too good,
Réné de Laudonnière himself turning over to her
and to Madame two rooms of his quarters. After
seeing to their comfort I set about to aid in landing
the munitions of war. This was safely done by the
end of the second day and the new ordnance was
mounted upon the battlements which thus commanded
the river for a great distance. The shed
now gave place to a stronger construction under the
bastions and all worked with so great a vigor that
new life animated the poor fort which but a few
days before had come nigh to being deserted. Never
had the prospects of the colony been brighter, and
it seemed as if at last Fortune was smiling upon
their efforts, which under careful management were
about to be crowned with success.</p>

<p>’Tis a strange thing how misfortune doth pursue
even when all else in nature seems to smile. It was,
I think, at midnight of the fifth day that the first
great shadow fell upon the luckless settlement. We
were sitting around the council table in the barracks
discussing the plans of Laudonnière for the extension
of the colony. Ribault sat at the end of the
table, his brows knit in deep thought, his hands
clasped upon the table and his beard falling down
to his lap. He was much perturbed over a report
which had come to him that two sails had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
sighted far out to sea just as the night was falling.
From time to time he would nod to one or the other,
but he spoke little. At his right were Laudonnière,
Vasseur, Verdier, the Swiss, Arlac, Ottigny, and
Satouriona the great Carib chief with whom the
Admiral was bent upon making a friendship. At
his left were Saint Marie, Yonville and La Grange.
Yonville was speaking of the magic mine of gold
and silver that La Roquette had found which would
yield ten thousand crowns apiece for every colonist
and fifteen hundred thousand crowns for the King.
The Admiral listened gravely, but he was a practical
man and had no such flighty notions as these young
gentlemen.</p>

<p>I tired at last of listening to their vaporings and
moved to one of the casements where I sat listening
and looking out into the night, drinking in the perfumes
of the forest which the breezes of the sea were
wafting toward me. Outside all was quiet save for
the call of a night bird or the cry of some beast of
prey as it prowled on its midnight hunt. The rain
had fallen so that the odor was almost overpowering,
and it was damp out toward the sea, where the
clouds hung heavily with but a slight break overhead.
There was a glimmer here and there from the
water under the bastions. Down near the river’s
mouth I fancied I could see the twinkling of the
lanthorns upon the <i>Trinity</i> as she swung to the tide;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
but the ships were almost too far away for that.
My thoughts turned to Diane and I wondered—</p>

<p>But as I looked into the distance toward where
the ships should lay, there came suddenly two flashes
of light, one beside the other, like lightning and yet
not to be mistaken. I started, with an exclamation,
straining my eyes, my heart beating furiously.
Then clear and distinct as though but half a league
away there came the sound of cannon shots!</p>

<p>Ribault and his officers sprang to where I stood,
breathless, all a-fever with the excitement of the
moment. They had not long to wait. For again
the flashes came, by twos and threes, and then by
broadsides, the echoes coming up the river like the
roaring of distant thunder. There was commotion
outside and the sentry opened the door crying
“The Spaniards! The Spaniards!”</p>

<p>The drums beat to arms and most of the soldiers and
the women too rushed out into the courtyard, where
they ran hither and thither asking questions which
no one could answer. The Admiral commanding
silence, mounted with Ottigny and Laudonnière to the
battlements where he listened and watched intently
for some minutes. He knew the serious import of
those sounds and what they might mean to the
ships lying out there, under-manned and unprepared
for battle. He knew too that the sentry had said
the truth when he uttered the fear that was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
his own heart. The Spanish fleet had come to
Florida!</p>

<p>Ribault came down from the battlements and
without more ado ordered all his seamen and officers
to the four smaller ships at anchor in the river.
To the landing place we ran in great haste, stopping
only to seize armor and weapons. In half an
hour our little vessels were sailing down toward
the mouth of the river. No one of us spoke, but
we stood along the bulwarks listening to the sound
of the cannon. It was more distant now, and
from its direction we knew that the three larger
ships were making out to sea. Should we be in
time?</p>

<p>In a moment the lookout upon the fore-castle of
the <i>Jesus</i> came running aft and reported that there
were sounds ahead close inboard. We listened intently
and in a moment heard the sound of oars
grinding violently in their irons and the swash of a
ship’s boat through the water. A voice shouted
hoarsely across the water the words “France!
France!” Our men stood crooked over the bulwarks,
their weapons at their shoulders, trying to
pierce the darkness, and soon we could just make out
a gray shadow bearing directly upon us. There was
great tension as she drew nearer and the gunners blew
their torches, ready to blow her out of the water at
the first sign the least suspicious. Slowly she drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
alongside and we saw that it was a barge of the
<i>Trinity</i>. An officer came hastily over the gangway.
It was Bachasse, a sub-lieutenant.</p>

<p>Ribault went to him, and the soldiers crowded
around.</p>

<p>“Is it the Spaniards?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It is, your Excellency,” replied Bachasse shortly.
He was stout and of a brusque manner—as brave a
seaman as ever stood his watch.</p>

<p>“They came upon us late this afternoon, in five
ships,” he said. “Captain Bourdelais wished me to
report that we were not prepared for battle. Half of
our crews are at the Fort.” He paused.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Ribault, sternly. “Tell me all and
omit nothing.”</p>

<p>“It was dark before they came upon us in earnest,
our men were waiting at their guns. There was a
trumpet from the Spanish flagship. Captain Bourdelais
answered from the <i>Trinity</i>. We saw lanthorns
and a figure upon the great vessel and we heard a
strong voice say:</p>

<p>“‘Whence does this fleet come?’</p>

<p>“‘From France,’ Captain Bourdelais replied at
once.</p>

<p>“‘What are you doing here?’</p>

<p>“‘We bring soldiers and supplies for a fort which
the King of France has built and for many others
which he will soon build.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Are you Catholics or Lutherans?’ said the
voice.</p>

<p>“‘We are Lutherans! we are Lutherans! Who
are you?’</p>

<p>“‘I am Pedro Menendez, general of the fleet of
the King of Spain. At daybreak I will board your
ships and every heretic shall die!’</p>

<p>“Then our men broke into laughter and jeering;
‘You are cowards,’ they shouted, ‘come at
once.’</p>

<p>“Then they came down upon us. Captain Bourdelais
ordered the cables cut, for we were at a disadvantage.
All of the ships put to sea. My Captain
has sent me to you. They fired upon this boat but
we escaped. They are now fighting upon the sea—and
this is my report.” When he had finished he
bowed and stood silent.</p>

<p>The Admiral stroked his beard. The worst had
happened and he saw that it would be war to the
death. He told Bachasse to order his men upon deck
and to make his boat fast to the stern of the <i>Jesus</i>.
Then they came up carrying one who had been
killed. So we sailed on down to the mouth of the
river.</p>

<p>We saw no more gun-flashes and only now and
then could we hear a sound far out to sea which told
us where the ships were sailing. I doubted not that
it was wise of Captain Bourdelais to slip his cable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and run for the open; with a good wind he might
escape. By and by we heard no sounds at all.</p>

<p>The Admiral was for going in pursuit of the flying
ships, but called a consultation of his officers in the
cabin and they advised against it. Fort Caroline
would be without vessels or men to protect it, and
the Spanish fleet might sail up within range and
batter the bastions down. Their counsel at last
prevailed, and at dawn the soldiers were landed upon
the beach. The <i>Jesus</i> and three other vessels cast
anchor in an arm of the sea behind the beach, broadside
on, so that the soldiers might be protected by a
brave cannon fire. Then the bowmen and arquebusiers
dug into the sand, making trenches in which
they might find protection from arrows and small
pieces.</p>

<p>These were moments of great anxiety. It was
not until the sun had mounted well into the sky
that some sentinels who had been watching down
the beach, reported a sail coming up with the brisk
wind. By ten o’clock she was in plain sight and
from her great bulk we made her out to be the
Spanish flag-ship <i>San Pelayo</i>. She could not have
been less than a thousand tons burthen; and came
beautifully, sailing outside the outer bar just beyond
the range of our long pieces. She wore three yellow
streaks along her sides where her gun tiers were,
and her sails, crossed with great red stripes and bars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
never spilled a cupful as they bellied out into the
wind and bore her onward, though she was dipping
and pitching in the chop as she went by. Her
bulwarks gleamed in the sunlight with the lines of
polished helmets; and though I had no spying-glass
I fancied that high up near her lanthorns I could
make out the Adelantado and by his side the stalwart
figure of Diego de Baçan. I bit my lips and
hoped they might try to make the entrance of the
river.</p>

<p>But they threw the ship up into the wind, where
she courtesied disdainfully, and then a scornful puff
of smoke came from her side and a shot struck in
the first line of surf. She hung there a minute and
then squared away down the beach again. The
Adelantado was discreet as well as valiant. Late
in the afternoon three other sail were sighted,
and it was soon seen that they were French. At
sunset they were near enough and a boat put off
from the <i>Gloire</i>, Captain Cosette himself coming
ashore through the surf to make his report. He had
followed the Spaniards to San Augustin and had
seen that they had landed their stores and negroes
and were rapidly entrenching themselves.</p>

<p>Many of these facts have been set forth in the
writings of the Captain Laudonnière, and of Challeux
the carpenter; and some stories have been written
by the Spaniard Barcia and by Mendoza, the priest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Yet it is proper that everything bearing upon the
events which are to follow should be known to all
Christians, that they may rightly judge between these
people and us.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />
<small>WE PUT TO SEA.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">After waiting all night and part of the next
day we returned to the Fort, leaving a guard
upon the beach, with cannon to assist the ships
should they be attacked.</p>

<p>That night there was a council of war. Laudonnière
was sick in his bed, so we went to his chamber,
standing and sitting at the bedside. There were La
Grange, Sainte Marie, Ottigny, Visty, Yonville, De
Brésac and others. The Admiral spoke boldly and
at some length. He outlined his plan, which was
nothing less than an immediate attack by sea upon
San Augustin, before the Spaniards had time to
well entrench themselves against attack. His eye
flashed as he spoke and he was good to see, for
there is naught so fine as the light of battle in the
eyes of a man of years. The younger men were
with him body and heart, for the very boldness of
the plan was to their liking.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Laudonnière answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
favoring the plan of remaining at Fort Caroline to
fortify it against attack. La Grange and Sainte
Marie got upon their feet and spoke briefly to the
same effect. They all said that having lived in
these parts for nearly two years, they were better
qualified to speak of these things; they thought it
dangerous to venture upon that coast in the month
of September or October, for the storms came with
terrible swiftness and devastation.</p>

<p>Ribault reproved them for their timidity, asking
whether they were valiant sailor-men of France or
dogs of Spaniards? Then he read a letter from
Admiral Coligny which he took to be an order to
attack this same Admiral Pedro Menendez if he
ventured within the dominions of New France. By
sea, the distance was short and the route explored.
It was the proper strategy. With a sudden blow
we would capture or destroy the Spanish ships, and
master the troops on shore before their companions
upon the sea could arrive.</p>

<p>Laudonnière, having been superseded in his command,
had no actual control in the matter, and
though the Admiral spoke kindly to him and to the
other officers, the orders were at once issued for the
expedition. In order that there might be no possibility
of miscarriage, the most of the available men
of the Fort as well as of the ships were to be taken.
Not only were all the officers and soldiers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
new expedition to go but also La Caille, Laudonnière’s
sergeant-major, his Ensign—Arlac, De Brésac
a friend of La Caille, Ottigny, La Grange and the very
pick of his men.</p>

<p>This was little to my liking. With these men
gone and Laudonnière ill, the Fort lay practically
at the mercy of the enemy, were they Spaniards or
Indians. The Sieur de la Notte would come upon
the <i>Trinity</i> in spite of all that I could urge, for
though not born to the command of men, he had a
love for play with the steel and went where he felt
his duty strongest.</p>

<p>I could not conceal my fears, even from the
Vicomte de la Notte. All that was for me in this
world would be left behind in a crumbling fort with
no one to defend. Of those to remain, but seventeen
men of Laudonnière and nine or ten of Ribault were
in condition to bear arms, and some of these were
servants, one of them being the Admiral’s cook and
two others his dog-boys. There was an old carpenter
of threescore named Challeux, two shoemakers,
an old cross-bow maker, a player upon the spinet
and four valets—a beggarly array of fighting men
surely to defend the one hundred and fifty women,
children and camp-followers the Admiral would
leave behind! I went to him, but he would not
listen to me. His mind was made to carry out all
these plans, he said; and so I left him. La Grange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and Ottigny went to him again; but we saw that it
was useless. I then sought Madame and Mademoiselle
in their chamber in the living quarters.</p>

<p>We had only a short time, but Mademoiselle and
I went out upon the bastion and stood by the
breeching of one of the cannon, looking out to sea.
The air was close and sultry and not a breath stirred
the trees to the back of us or rippled the surface of
the river that flowed, deep and sluggish, below. The
leaves, half turned in color and wet by a rain-storm
during the night, hung sere and motionless. The
standard above our heads hung closely about the
staff, drooped and faded. The ships in the river
were shaking out their sails, which fell heavily and
hung from their yards in straight and listless folds
to the deck. The men moved down from the Fort
to the boats as though they had no joy in the undertaking.
There was no gleam upon their breastpieces,
for the sun did not shine that morning, and
never the rollicking song that means so much to the
man-at-arms. I was in no cheerful disposition, and
there was a reflection of my mood in the manner of
Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>“There is no great danger,” I began, “and we will
return within the week. I have asked your father
to stay, as he can be of no great service in a culverin
fight, or a fight of ships. But he will go.”</p>

<p>“If there is a battle,” she smiled, “it were difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to keep him where the women and children are. He
hath ever given a good account of himself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mademoiselle, but he should not go.”</p>

<p>I said it in a tone so convincing that she looked
at me to get my meaning. I had not meant to betray
my uneasiness to her, but with her woman’s
wit she guessed my thought.</p>

<p>“You are thinking of us,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>I did not answer. I looked down at the ground,
tapping my boot with my scabbard.</p>

<p>“I know not what it is, Mademoiselle, but my
mind is deep in melancholy.”</p>

<p>She looked across to the pine barrens, sighing.</p>

<p>“It is the dying of the year or some movement
of the elements,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Yes, doubtless that is it.”</p>

<p>And then we both sat silent again.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, you know that Don Diego de
Baçan is there,” I said at last, pointing to the southward.
“If anything should happen that we do not
return so soon as we expect, promise me that you will
yourself cause a private watch to be kept at the gates
of Fort Caroline. If there are signs of attack, go at
once with Madame to the woods. Forgive me,
Mademoiselle, for asking you to bear a part of my
uneasiness, but there are not many wise heads at
Fort Caroline.”</p>

<p>She smiled a little at my eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have no fear of Diego de Baçan, or Menendez
de Avilés,” she replied, “but I will do as you wish.”
She then took from the breast of her gown a straight
dagger, long and fine. As I looked at it a chill
went over me and I held up my hands before my
eyes.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle!” I cried in
anguish.</p>

<p>She held the weapon poised a moment on her
finger-tips looking at it strangely, then slowly set it
in its sheath and returned it to her breast. I looked
her in the eyes and they were calm. I knew that
she would do as she meant. She stood straight as
any one of Satouriona’s warriors, smiling bravely
at me, and I wished that I might take her in my
arms and tell her all that I would before we parted.
I looked up at her, my hands trembling to touch her,
my eyes wide with adoration; and something came
over her then that she knew how deep I loved her.
For a great tear came to her eye and trickled down
upon her cheek. But she brushed it away brusquely
with the back of her hand. She thrust her fingers
toward me, turning her head away; and I pressed
them to my lips, kissing them blindly—blindly
many times.</p>

<p>“God bless you, Mademoiselle!” I murmured.</p>

<p><a href="#image01">Then I left her.</a> That was the memory of Diane
de la Notte I carried out to sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>We entered pinnaces at about four of the afternoon
and put out across the bar for the <i>Trinity</i>, which,
swinging wide at her anchorage, rolled upon the
glassy water, light as a feather. For the cargo was
out of her and she sat high and proud, for all the
world like a great swan. There was no air stirring
and the surface of the sea was like oil,—I felt again
the same ominous foreboding of impending evil.
There had been a storm somewhere, for the waves
rolled in and burst with a roar upon the beach below
us. It was choppy over the bar, but beyond a
wetting we got upon the ship safely enough. I liked
not the looks of the sky and sea. Overhead the
clouds hung dark and heavy, for though ’twas a full
hour before sunset the sky was so gloomy that all
the lanthorns below were lighted. We could see all
around the horizon, for the air was most clear and
the blue black line of it came strong against the
coppery glow of the heavens to the east and southward.
The sand upon the shore gleamed white by
contrast against the dark green of the pines beyond,
which cut across the sky-line so black that you could
see with distinctness each particular needle and spur.
The thunder of the surf was loud above the dip and
murmur of the ship, and to the southward along the
coast as far as the eye could reach the white lines
of froth, growing smaller and smaller in the distance,
rolled in from the outer bar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no pleasant berth for a ship of our size
upon a lee shore. She could not go into any of the
rivers as the <i>Pearl</i> and the <i>Jesus</i> could, and I was
for putting to sea at once, where in the open we
could clew up everything and run for it if a storm
were brewing. The Admiral and the Captain Bourdelais
were upon the after-castle in conversation and
looking at the sky or up the river toward the Fort,
where the Captain La Grange, with one of the vessels
of Laudonnière, still tarried. It was plain to be seen
that they liked the looks of the weather no better
than I, for in a little while orders were passed forward
to secure everything for sea, and the anchor
was hove up to a short cable. Before dark La
Grange appeared, and as a light breeze had sprung
up, signals were flashed and we put out to sea under
all plain sail. As soon as the sheets had been
trimmed aft and the course had been set down the
coast, I took a lanthorn and lay below decks with
one of the midship’s men of the watch to see that
all was secure in the hold and cabins.</p>

<p>When I went under the half deck and opened the
hatch to the quarters of the men, a cloud of blue
smoke rolled out and I thought there must be a
fire. There, upon a sea-chest, sitting most disconsolate,
was my Englishman, Job Goddard. Around
him in a half-moon was a crowd of the French
bowmen and arquebusiers holding their sides and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
laughing at his plight. For while I looked he put
his hand upon his stomach, retching and groaning
like a person ill unto death.</p>

<p>“Why, how now, Job Goddard,” I laughed—for
the ship was pitching—“is this your maiden
voyage?”</p>

<p>But Goddard only bent the further forward, and
the bowmen laughed the more. At this I feared
’twas serious, for Goddard was no man to be laughed
at by any Frenchman.</p>

<p>I went over to him and clapped my hand upon
his shoulder. “Chut, man,” said I half angrily,
“what is it? Speak up!”</p>

<p>And with that he turned toward me the sorriest
look and wryest face I have ever beheld upon mortal
man. But he made no sign that he heard me or
indeed that he was aware of my presence, only gripping
his middle and groaning the louder. I made
a shrewd guess that ’twas no vital sickness that had
come upon him, and remembering how I had once
before seen a man cured of some such an ailment,
without further ado I fetched him a resounding
whack upon the thigh.</p>

<p>I had not counted upon so speedy a recovery, for
I had scarce time to spring behind him when he flew
into the air and in the very thick of the Frenchmen—striking
this way and that with feet and hands,
until two of the arquebusiers measured their length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
upon the floor and the rest of them were flying in
all directions before the fury of his onslaught.
Unable longer to restrain myself I burst into a fit of
laughter, which even my sense of authority could not
withhold.</p>

<p>It was not until then that Goddard espied me.
His countenance fell and he looked around him as
though to gather his wits. But in a moment he
walked over to his sea-chest, and I saw that he had
been sucking upon one of these tobacco reeds which
Vasseur had described to me. He looked at the
packet and bowl a moment stupidly and then, with
a sudden motion, dashed them upon the deck, where
they broke into a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>Then and not until then would he speak.</p>

<p>“Blow me, sir,” said he, “if I bean’t sick at me
stomick.” The expression of his face at this unaccustomed
sensation was so comical that I could not
blame the Frenchmen, and I laughed as loud as the
best of them.</p>

<p>The next morning when within but two leagues of
San Augustin the wind fell again to the same dead,
sluggish calm of the day before, and we could make
no progress; but plain to the naked eye behind the
sand spit at the entrance showed the vessels of the
Spaniards, where they had anchored to receive us.</p>

<p>The weather by now was growing thicker and
thicker, and in an hour we saw that a squall would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
strike us. We had barely time to get our canvas in
when down it came with great force and away we
rode trying to bear up against it. Close as we hauled
we could not get to the harbor and give battle;
and so the Admiral, seeing that some of the smaller
vessels would be blown ashore, signaled for all to
follow, and under storm-sails stood off until the
tempest should abate. Had we held on so close to
that lee shore some of our vessels must surely have
fallen into the hands of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>But the storm showed no sign of abating. Before
noon the wind increased to such a force that the
vessels could wear but their very lightest canvas;
and heavy gusts of wind came now and then, in which
those sails cracked and strained, the ship groaning
like a thing in pain.</p>

<p>Bourdelais stood upon the poop glancing first at
the slatting canvas and then at the Spanish vessels
within the harbor, growing every moment more indistinct
in the wrack and mist under our lee. De
Brésac, who had stood fingering his sword-hilt impatiently,
awaiting the beginning of the battle, had
railed so openly at the Admiral’s decision to put to
sea, that he had been sent below, like a sulky boy,
to recover his usual tepor. Salvation Smith had
stopped reading to Job Goddard from the “Martyrs,”—his
accustomed relish before going into battle—and
sat moody and dispirited in the lee of the barge in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the waist, while his companion swore softly to himself.</p>

<p>I doubted not, it was a wise decision to put to sea,
but to me it seemed a bitter thing to be forced to
turn aside from a battle which meant so much to us
all. If Ribault himself had any doubts as to his decision,
he did not show them; for he paced up and
down the quarter-deck, his calm demeanor setting
a worthy example in forbearance to the younger and
less moderate among us, who were anxious to be up
and at our enemies, and found small pleasure in a
sailing drill upon the ocean when other and more
troublous business might have been doing.</p>

<p>The next day the wind went down. From green
the sea had turned to gray. But the waves did not
break in masses of foam. They boiled along, churning
and seething as though disturbed by some mighty
current beneath. Only the crest, in a wall of amber
thin as parchment, was tossed up to curl and break
in a jet of spray; and broken lines of gray swayed
and rolled athwart the trough where the foam had
been. The clouds from brown had turned to a heavy
blue, the color of a Spanish blade. They hung low
and menacing, while great fingers of them curled and
twisted like furies, or shot out in long lines here
and there to be torn to pieces and carried in shreds
down to leeward.</p>

<p>For six days this weather continued. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
no great danger to the ships so long as it blew no
harder. The Admiral was running around this
mounthsoun, as he called it, which came up from
the south. Could we but go through it, all danger
would be past; but in this sea it would have been
destruction to some of his fleet to have hazarded an
approach to San Augustin again. We could get no
sight of clear sky; but by the drift and speed I made
it that we had gone three hundred leagues or so to
the north and into the Mares’ sea, as it has come
to be called.</p>

<p>Here we saw no longer the great rollers of the
coast, for the wind now blew fitfully from the east
and the waves ran first in one way and then in another.
The sky lightened a little and the Admiral,
thinking the storm had gone out to sea, shifted his
helm and put about again.</p>

<p>The Sieur de la Notte, who was chafing under
this delay, could hardly restrain his great anxiety.
The Spaniards had seen us struggling in the face
of the storm and might conceive the bold project
to attack Fort Caroline before the ships returned.
The very thought of it filled my heart with dread,
and I could not forbear speaking of it to Ribault.</p>

<p>That was the only time I had ever seen him angry.
He flashed upon me, his features distorted with rage.
He had seized a pin from the rail and I thought for
the moment he would strike me with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“You Anglais are always meddling,” he shouted.
“What have you to do with this command?”</p>

<p>But I did not move. I looked at him squarely
and some one took the pin away from him; then he
went below.</p>

<p>It was plain to see, none the less, that the situation
of the French and the Spanish had changed.
Here were we, many leagues upon the ocean, at the
mercy of the winds and seas; while the Spaniards,
our deadliest enemies, outnumbering us two to one,
were ashore, and but two days’ march from all we
had in New France—all the most of us had anywhere
upon the face of the earth!</p>

<p>Would we never come to land again? And,
Mademoiselle!</p>

<p>I dared not think!</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />
<small>THE HERICANO.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">We were sailing toward the shore again, but
the wind had gone down and the <i>Trinity</i>
moved sluggishly enough through the heavy swells,
making scarce a league an hour. But this was a
humor of the elements and meant nothing—or everything.
In those latitudes a ship-master should ever
be in a plague and torment.</p>

<p>It was three weeks that we had been upon the
sea, when one night, at the beginning of October,
four of the ships still being in company, there
broke a storm, the equal of which I have never
had the ill-fortune to behold. And it was afterwards
told me by Indians of Emola that never had
there been known such a tempest upon that coast.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant Bachasse had the watch on deck.
I was standing by his side. Suddenly far down on
the starboard quarter we heard a roaring like that of
the surf upon the shore; only it was a hundred times
greater and had in it something more ominous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
terrible. The sky was black as soot in that direction,
and though we peered through the darkness we could
see nothing there. More and more distinct it grew,
and then we could make out a line of white growing
more plain with each second. Bachasse was giving
some hoarse orders to have the sails and yards lowered,
when the Admiral rushed from his cabin clad
only in shirt and breeches.</p>

<p>“Dieu nous bénisse!” he shouted. “It is the
hericano! Set her stern to it, mes gars, for your
lives!”</p>

<p>I knew what he meant and rushing to the starboard
tiller rope, caught the slack from the hand of
the man who stood there and ran it through the
pulley with all the strength and quickness I could
muster. I jammed it far over and hung on like death.</p>

<p>Amid the deafening noise, with the ripping and
slatting of the sails, the threshing of the ropes and
pollys, and the roaring of the sea above it all, I could
not think. I hung blindly to the tackle, loosing and
easing her as she felt the helm. I saw the main topsail
which had been reefed down, torn out of its ropes
and go flying entire like a great bird in the air, where
it vanished in the wrack and mist. Then the faces
blew out of the lanthorns, hitting and cutting us like
needles, and we were in darkness. I could dimly
make out the figures of the Admiral, Bourdelais, and
several others as they hung to the tackling at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
mizzen. I saw them put hand to mouth as though
shouting, but could hear no sound other than the
thundering of wind and sea.</p>

<p>The first shock had caught the ship fairly upon
her stern. Her nose had gone well down into the
smother, for I felt the poop rise high in the air as
though she were going all way over. Then she
fell back into the depths with a blow that seemed
to shake loose every joint and elbow in her hull.
A wave many feet high dashed over, washing forward
into the waist the man at my side and carrying
overboard everything that was not lashed to the rail
or mast. One of the lanthorns came down with a
crash, just missing me where I swung to the tiller-polly,
and swept down the slant of the after-castle,
carrying away the hand-rail of the mounting ladder
and vanishing into the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>The ship swayed and yawed frightfully from this
side to that. It was a moment fraught with dreadful
anxiety. The great tiller was smashing into the
bulwarks and pounding back against the tackle,
and it seemed for a moment as though the ship
would fall into the trough. With great difficulty
I reached the larboard tackle and hand over hand
gathered the slack of it in until both gearings
pulled alternately so that she seemed to be going
aright. These tackles I passed through a ring-bolt
to ease the strain, which pulled me this way and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that like a rope yarn. It was desperate work keeping
the feet; for with the great seas coming aboard
over the quarter and the swaying of the top hamper
from side to side I should have been thrown overboard
a dozen times but for the gripe upon the tiller
tackle. From the trough, the ship with a sickening
motion rose high into the air as though shot from
a saker; and then the deck fell away under the feet as
she was thrust forward by the mighty rush of wind
and wave behind her. Those great leaps were twice
the length of the <i>Trinity</i> herself, for we could not
have been going at a less rate than fifteen leagues an
hour. Before long there was a great crash up aloft
and the fore topmast was carried away, bringing down
the fore and main top gallant yards. There came
a pounding that jarred the ship grievously, but by
God’s Providence the wreckage tore away and went
by the board.</p>

<p>And yet it was most wonderful! I strained and
sweated at the tiller, all hot with the work, though
the spray was cutting my face like hail and I could
feel the sting of the rain-drops even through my
doublet. We were going to the westward now—to
Fort Caroline perhaps, and I cared not how
hard it blew. The spirit of the storm entered into
me and I was drunk—drunk with the speed and
motion, and mad with the struggle. The strain
upon endurance was great; but there came a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
feeling of the glory of it, and as I fought on I
prayed that no one might reach me. I set my teeth
till my jaws throbbed and throbbed again, while my
eyes watched the glow of the mass of foam forward
as the water dashed up and over the bows, at times
completely hiding the forward part of the ship.</p>

<p>I do not know how long I struggled there alone.
It may have been ten minutes—it may have been
an hour. But by and by I made out several figures
crawling along the larboard bulwarks, seizing hold
upon any rigging that came within their reach.
They were the Admiral, Job Goddard and one other.
When they could stand upright, Goddard and a
seaman took hold upon the tackles, thus relieving
me of a part of the strain. Then, in a while, Bachasse
came up from below, saying that the ship
was taking water both forward and aft and was
creaking piteously.</p>

<p>Matters were bad enough, for we could not be
far from the coast. Unless the wind veered to the
north, nothing could save us from the breakers.
The topsails had been blown to ribbons and the seas
would have set us on our beam ends or the wind
would have overset us completely had we tried to
put the ship on the wind. And so we flew on, the
<i>Trinity</i> leaping every moment nearer to her death,
the waves dashing over and around her, sure of their
prey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Goddard swinging to his tackle leaned over till
his mouth was next my ear shouting,</p>

<p>“Tis a fine speed for enterin’ Paradise, Master
Sydney!”</p>

<p>All the night long we stood there, having now
and then a relief of four men upon the tackles, the
officers for the most part moving at their places of
duty and saying what they could of good cheer to
the men. The Sieur de la Notte came up toward
dawn and asked Captain Bourdelais what the
chances were. He being a person of few words
replied shortly, “The ship will be upon the beach
in three hours.”</p>

<p>Never had I seen the ocean wear so frightful a
mien as when the long night came at last to an
end. There was a gray waste about us and one
could see no color anywhere; the ocean was like
the dead ashes of a fire. At night we had not
been able to see; we could only feel the great motion,
and accustom ourselves. But by light of day
the <i>Trinity</i> seemed but a speck upon those waves.
At one moment, high as our top-hamper was, upon
all sides we could see nothing but great walls of
water, tumbling down upon us; the next we would
look over abysses which were bottomless, out across
a waste of foam which seemed to mingle and war
with the cloud flakes that fell down upon it.</p>

<p>Among the soldiers there was great fear; for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had no stomach for such business as this. Even the
seamen, many of them hardy in service, had lost
their wits completely. Once when a wave had come
aboard an old boatswain dashed terror-stricken into
the half-deck and fore-castle shouting,</p>

<p>“The cabin is stove in,—we are sinking!” and
three arquebusiers crazy with fear jumped overboard.
One of the fine gentry of the cabin, with a satin
coat, came running wild-eyed from below and falling
upon his knees threw his hands in the air raving that
should he reach land he would be no more a Lutheran,
but a good Catholic, as he always was.</p>

<p>Providence intervened, for a sea struck him fairly
in the face and he, having no hold—by reason of his
hands being up—was overset backwards and vanished
with a shriek. Salvation Smith disappeared,
and came upon deck again dressed in a suit of black
which he had taken from some half-dead gentleman
in the cabin, “to go before the Holy Trinity in a
fitting manner,” as he solemnly said. Another seaman,
getting most drunk upon <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau de vie</i> ran amuck
with a pike, maiming and hurting several.</p>

<p>It was about two hours of the morning watch when
the waves seemed to grow suddenly less in length;
and though the wind still roared as fiercely as ever,
and the foam flew by us in scattering flakes or
lashed furiously against the masts and shrouds, it was
plain to be seen we were coming into the shallows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
The <i>Trinity</i> moved more steadily, and that showed
the better the great speed at which we were making
for the beach. The wrack and the spume hid everything
ahead, but I thought in a moment I could mark
a white jet here and there which showed where the
breakers were. Bourdelais saw them too, for he
rushed to the tiller-tackles. The Admiral stood at
the break of the poop, calm and quiet as though at
a sailing drill, ready to set the bows straight for the
beach when the end was near. The tackle crew were
straining at the tiller watching the yawing of the
ship and the motions of the hands of Bourdelais as
he gave the course.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the mist ahead I saw a line of
white, leaping and writhing as far as the eye could
reach to starboard and larboard; and then another
beyond it, rolling onward. We came up to them
and were soon in the midst of the seething, churning
mass of white as the <i>Trinity</i> went pounding over
the outer bar. She hung there a moment, reluctant;
and then dashed forward again like a poor desperate
creature hunted by the hounds, with a great straining
leap. Everything was white about us now, and
we had barely time to note the yellow strip of the
beach under the bows, when with pitiful tremble
and a quiver that went through her, bow and stern,
the poor ship took her death blow with a dreadful
crash and brought up hard and fast upon the sands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The white tongues of surf licked her sides greedily,
and sea after sea made clean breaches over bows
and waist as though impatient to engulf her. So
fairly and fast had we struck that the waves which
followed us did not at first swing her broadside to
the beach. But at last the drag of the wreck of the
spars to larboard, added to the stress of the wind,
pulled her around and we swung high up completely
wrecked.</p>

<p>We were in bad case. Now we could plainly see
the line of the beach with its backing of brown sand
grasses and here and there a patch of dark where
the gnarled firs and bay trees grew sparsely in the
dunes.</p>

<p>The wrack and spray were flying thick, and the
great waves behind drove completely over the vessel,
wedging her farther up and making her destruction
more certain. Yet one thing we noted. There
were no rocks or reefs; only the long line of gently
shelving beach. It seemed that with care we might all
be saved; but there was not a moment to be lost.
Bachasse went below again, with a carpenter, and
found the hold turned into a small sea, which had
flowed over the provision lockers and buried them
under six feet of water. The surges were washing
this way and that and seemed like to rend the timbers
apart. Already a sea, larger than the others, had
torn off one of the quarter galleries, and this wreckage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
had floated up on the beach, where it lay in the
drift of the spent sea.</p>

<p>No boats could swim in that surf. So a most
fearless young Frenchman, called Brunel, sprang
into the waves with a rope about his body and
struck out for the shore. It was not far to the
shallows, and but for the anger of the waves it
would have been an easy passage. We watched
the swimmer borne along; now he was carried ahead
shoreward in the very cap of a wave, and then he was
swept back in the hollow toward the ship. It was a
fine struggle. Twice he disappeared, and we thought
he must have gone; but in a moment a great wave
took him and bore him well onward in its topping
of foam. Then he was up to his shoulders in the
brine, fighting desperately for a foothold. Soon we
saw him rise and work his way to the dry beach,
where he fell and lay exhausted.</p>

<p>But after a little space he rose, waving his hands,
and ropes were attached to his line. These Brunel
hauled ashore and made fast to trees among the
sand hills. Over these other men went, hand over
hand; and soon two pollys with their tackling were
traveling back and forth carrying the company
ashore, many of them bearing their armor and accoutrements.</p>

<p>The work had been done none too speedily. A
dozen or so of the company remained on the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
when we heard below decks the creaking of the timbers
as the bolts pulled out and split them apart.
Captain Bourdelais now urged the Admiral to go
ashore; he would not, saying that none should leave
after him,—a matter which Bourdelais and Bachasse
disputed. There they stood with their hands on
their hearts, all three bowing to one another as
though at some fine levee of the Court. I had no
humor for this business, for ’twas no place for foot-scraping.
I was minded to get ashore without further
ado, and so sprang to the tackle, which I hitched
about my body. I had no more than done so when
there was a great crashing and the deck suddenly
fell away under my feet, throwing me into the sea.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />
<small>WHAT BEFELL US UPON THE SAND-SPIT.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Down I went, the water roaring about my ears
and my body pulled this way and that by the
undertow which swept me fiercely up and down. I
opened my eyes, but the surf was full of foam and
sand, so I closed them. I felt that I was being borne
out to sea, and scarce had the mind to continue the
struggle. Then came a sudden wrench. For a moment
I thought I must have been crushed among the
timbers, and to this day have often wondered that
it was not so. But the strain was steady and then
relaxed and I remembered the rope which I had put
about me and knew it was the taughtening of the
tackle about my shoulders. As my body touched
the sandy bottom, with a mighty effort and springing
upward I reached the surface, bewildered and all but
exhausted. About, in all directions, were tossing
pieces of the wreckage. I reached a spar with difficulty
and to it clung, warding off meanwhile as
best possible the planks and gratings which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
dashing all around. I saw five or six men floating
near and among them to my great joy marked the
figure of the Admiral, clinging to a spar. He saw
me at the same moment and feebly raised a hand
in acknowledgment. Fearing he might lose his
hold, and watching my chance, I swam to him and
set him astride the yard. He seemed to have no
will or power of his own and I thought he must have
been badly injured.</p>

<p>“Are you much hurt, monsieur?” I asked him
while I struggled to raise him. He made no great
effort to aid me and would have toppled over again
had I not held him firmly.</p>

<p>“I do not know, my friend,” he replied, “and I
care not.”</p>

<p>Then I discovered there was a cut upon the back
of his head, which was bleeding freely, dyeing his
linen and doublet a sombre hue and marking in
greater contrast the pallor of his face.</p>

<p>“Be of good cheer,” I said as cheerfully as I
might, “we will be ashore in a moment, sir.” By
the tackle about me, we were presently hauled
through the surf and reached the shallows, where a
dozen arms plucked us from our hazardous hold
and landed us high upon the beach.</p>

<p>The perils of the last two days, ending in the position
into which we were thrown, had taken my
thoughts from the desperate fear at my heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Until then—until we were surely wrecked and saw
all destroyed before our eyes, we had hoped at least
to get back to Fort Caroline before the Spaniards
could attack. I made no doubt they would do that
at the earliest moment if indeed they had not done
so already.</p>

<p>My God! For the first time the horrible chances
came upon and overwhelmed me. Wrecked and
ruined upon an unknown and barren coast with the
Indians on one side and the Spaniards perhaps
barring our way to Fort Caroline and Mademoiselle!
I was weak and could not bear to think more. The
horror of it overcame me! I rose to my feet and
strode up the beach like one distraught, breasting the
flying sand and peering fruitlessly through the mist,
vainly searching for some familiar mark to judge of
our whereabouts. The motion of struggling against
the wind seemed to lessen the dreadful ferment of
mind; and bare-handed and worn as I was, no wish
remained except only to press onward to Mademoiselle,
or learn that she was safe. Once above the
roaring of the storm I heard a sound like the cry of
a woman and, with heart a-leap started running
with all my might. But it was only some shrill
creature which swirled near on the wind, uttering
its storm-cry. On I struggled, heat and fever making
riot of thought, until I fell again exhausted to the
beach. I remember closing my eyes, but the eyeballs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
swam in a red mist and burned so that I opened
them again. Then I seemed to sleep and dream.
I saw dimly a woman seated at a table in a room.
Back of her and around her were many men in armor,
and their hands and faces were streaked with the red.
It was Mademoiselle! By her side, leaning forward
toward her, was a man, his eyes swimming as he gazed
and his white teeth gleaming hatefully through his
beard. He had a mug upraised, from which the
liquor was spilling about as he pledged her, laughing
coarsely the while. I could hear him too; for there
was a gruesome reality about it. The others watched
amused. He reached toward her, and I saw her
shrink to a corner, away. He came again. She took
a dagger from her bosom. Then drew herself up
cold, white, and set, the weapon in both hands at
her heart. No one moved. They stood, those men
in armor, their hands raised, like statues. There
was silence, deadly and oppressive; and I was dumb
too and could make no sound. Then everything
grew red again and I saw no more. In my agony I
dug my nails deep into the sand and I cried aloud,
calling to God. It was not so! It could not be so!
I was mad! Yes, yes,—I knew that I was mad, and
that comforted me.</p>

<p>By and by—it was a long while—for the clouds
had broken and the light of the sun had gone high
in the heavens—I grew better and stronger and got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
upon my feet. Cold and wet, the wind cut sharp as
a knife, but the fever had gone, and I laughed
aloud to think of the fool I had been. The situation
was hopeless enough, but we were strong men, many
of us bearing weapons and armor, and much might
be done. When the storm abated the other ships
would put in and take us aboard. All would yet be
well. Even if the ships did not come we would
make a forced march through the backwoods, persuading
friendly Indians to guide and aid us. We
might not be far—perhaps only half a dozen leagues
from Fort Caroline.</p>

<p>I went back down the beach the wind at my back,
warming with the new impulse until I was soon running
again. I found I had gone near a league to the
northward, and it was many minutes before I was
back among the company. They had moved behind
the sand dunes the better to find shelter from the
wind. Fires had been kindled and around these
they huddled wretchedly, drying their clothing.
There was nothing to eat save a few biscuits which
had been washed up in a cask, and these were salt-soaked
and unpleasing to the taste. Some of the
men had gone down the beach, where they found
some ledges of moss and rock and brought back a
few shell-fish. These they ate raw from the shells;
but I was not hungry and they seemed unsightly to
me, so I could find no stomach for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>When I came up La Caille, the sergeant-major,
approached.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” he asked, “what do you find? Is
San Augustin to the north or the south?”</p>

<p>“To the north, I should say. But there is nothing
but sand and sea so far as the eye can reach.”
He turned to De Brésac gloomily and together
they walked in the direction from which I had
come.</p>

<p>Admiral Ribault sat upon the sand, a rag binding
his temples, his head bent forward upon his breast,
the very presentment of misery. I went to him and
tried to say a few words of good cheer. But a deep
melancholy had settled upon the man, and he looked
down at the sand, saying nothing. I could see that
he was in no condition to speak upon any subject.
I felt, God knows, keen as he the desperate plight
in which we found ourselves. Yet, now that I had
come to myself, I knew that sighing would not
mend the matter and so went among the officers and
cavaliers for counsel. These I found to be in as
grievous a spirit as their Admiral. Broken in spirit
and sore in body, they felt horribly the loneliness
and the failure at the very beginning of a project
into which they had ventured all. By and by, Job
Goddard and Salvation Smith, who had gone down
the beach on a voyage of discovery, returned to the
camp. They had come upon two Indians and learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that San Augustin was fourteen leagues to the
northward.</p>

<p>“I bade them stay with us for dinner to-day, Master
Sydney,” said Goddard, cheerfully, “but they had
no stomach for truffles of shell-fish and wet biscuit.
The heathen scut! They fled to the woods as though
the fiend was after them. Salvation Smith fired at
them with an arquebus, but they vanished among the
trees unscathed. Salvation has a better knowledge
of the pike than of the arquebus, sir.”</p>

<p>That apostle of the Martyrs stood by, looking
ruefully at the weapon he held in his hand.</p>

<p>“True, sir,” said he at last, “’tis a toy for women
and lads. Give me a pike or a shaft and a good yew-bow
and I warrant our invitations will not be so
scorned another time.”</p>

<p>We were to the southward then! That was no
pleasant information, for Menendez lay between us
and the River of May; and the Indians, doubtless
those of Outina, at war with the friendly Satouriona,
would lose no time in letting the Spaniards know of
our whereabouts and condition. Some of the gentlemen
went into the forest, but came back cut by the
brambles, saying they saw no beasts nor food of any
kind and that they could not penetrate a rod into
the thicket; we should starve before receiving any
aid from that quarter. Of one thing I was soon convinced,—we
could not lie long upon the beach our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
mouths agape with hunger and thirst. And many
more of us feeling the same cravings, among them
Bachasse, Arlac, De Brésac and La Caille,—late that
night we persuaded the Admiral to set out upon a
march up the beach.</p>

<p>Many things save food had been brought upon the
shore, among them two trumpets, drums and two
standards. And so at dawn of the next day with
waving banners and beating drums, with some show
of gaiety and a martial spirit—though famished—we
set forth to the northward. Ribault, who walked
with the rear-guard, turned at the last to where the
timbers of the <i>Trinity</i> were scattered down the shore
as far as the eye could reach. He had grown ten
years older in the night and walked with Bourdelais
and the Sieur de la Notte, the mere shadow of the
man he had been at the Fort and upon the ship.
By and by some of the Huguenots set up a martial
hymn, which all the gentlemen sang with a fine
good will and rhythm, keeping the cadence of the
march. That seemed to put new life into them.
They were like children and, drawing their swords,
began looking to their weapons and jesting at the
chances of the good fight which might soon be.
They manfully tightened their girths to stay their
hunger and each vied with the other in good
humor and courage. But in the afternoon one
man, a great burly calker, threw up his hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
then fell down dead. They said his heart had
rotted.</p>

<p>It was a desperate expedition, and the reflection
of the Admiral’s melancholy, in spite of some flashes
of good cheer, was seen in the eyes of all who knew
the obstacles before us. Any man with half a seaman’s
eye could tell that any storm that had wrecked
the <i>Trinity</i> could not fail to beach the other vessels;
and few of us believed that we would be saved by them.
If we could but find a break in the impenetrable
forest and strike inland we might prey upon the Indians
and so by an easy detour at last reach the Fort.
Perhaps Menendez had put to sea again in the hope
of finding us storm-beaten and unprepared for battle.
If he had done this we might come quickly upon his
fort at the lodge of Seloy, and by audacity and
rapidity compass what mere strength or force of
numbers might not effect.</p>

<p>This was my hope, and the Admiral took great
heart when it was spoken to him. We would know
upon the morrow. In the afternoon the storm-clouds
blew away and the wind went down. The ocean
still lashed the beach sullenly, but the horizon clouds
to the eastward were tinged with pink, and with the
prospect of fair weather there was much happiness.
More shell-fish were found, the moisture of which
cooled the palate, though the taste was unpleasing,
and the saltiness made one long the more for fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
water and food. At about sunset we passed around
a point of land and abruptly came upon the timbers
of a vessel. The beams were split and the yellow
of the splinters showed most plainly that she had
been recently wrecked. A bit of the stern piece of
a pinnace was found, which bore the name of the
<i>Gloire</i> and then we knew that others of the French
fleet shared our fate. In a little while we made an
abrupt turn and came upon more wreckage and a
large party of our shipwrecked comrades.</p>

<p>The worst that we had expected had happened.
The French fleet was no more! I glanced at Jean
Ribault. His face was pale as death, and when he
saw these men before him his under-lip dropped
and his mouth fell open, his eyes expressing the bitterness
of soul he could not contain. He stopped
short and let his head fall forward. His muscles
loosened and I thought he would have fallen. But
at the touch of the Sieur de la Notte at his elbow,
he straightened again and casting his eyes heavenward,
said tremblingly, “The will of God be done!”</p>

<p>But all of Ribault’s officers were not discouraged.
Indeed upon the sight of so large a company many
of the men and soldiers took great heart again and
cried joyously to one another. The men we had
found were sailors of the <i>Gloire</i>, who had elected to
remain together upon the beach, until sighted by
some French ship while the main body of their company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
had gone northward. Others were of the <i>Petit-Jean</i>
and of the <i>Jesus</i>, which had gone ashore leagues
below. We numbered now three hundred and fifty
persons, and but for our hunger and the smallness
of the supply of powder and ball would have been a
formidable little army indeed. Captain Cosette of
the <i>Gloire</i>, who was there, embraced the Admiral
with great joy, and Bourdelais commanded a halt,
for the men of the <i>Trinity</i> were tired out. Many of
them dropped to the ground, and, forgetting their
hunger and their thirst fell mercifully into a deep
sleep in which they were left to rest.</p>

<p>I seemed to have no further sensation—even of
weariness. Quiet was more irksome to me than
aught else. I could not remain seated like the
others but must walk up and down upon the sand.
And yet I was not in a fever as before. It was easier
for me to think thus upon my feet. I felt myself
most calm in mind and could not understand how it
should be so when every new discovery went to confirm
the premonition of the doom that had hung over
us like a pall since that day—years ago it seemed—when
I had bade farewell to Mademoiselle upon the
bastion at Fort Caroline. It all came back upon me
as some dream, the stifling atmosphere, the ominous
elements, the listlessness of all things human and
animate upon the earth, and the misery which took
the joy from those last words with my love. Then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
thought of those red sunsets upon the ocean, when
we had sat upon the fore-castle laughing at our ill
omens and watched the great ball of fire drop down
into the purple mists of the hot western sea. Such
a sun there was this night—I mounted a sand hill
that I might see it the better. A yellow mist rose
from a swamp somewhere inland and the disk grew
to a greater size than I had ever seen. Yet one
could look at it squarely ere it had come to the
horizon, for it was not bright and seemed not to
be shining at all; only a great ball of blood poised
in the air, which one might almost reach out and
pluck from the sky. Then it fell down behind a
line of barren pine trees at the horizon, which cut
across it cold and clear as prison bars,—and in a
moment was gone.</p>

<p>When I went back the officers of the <i>Trinity</i> and
some of the other gentlemen had lit a fire and sat
in a circle upon the sand. A council of war was
held. The wilder blades were for pushing on at
once. Bourdelais stood up and on behalf of the
Admiral, said he, “We must be patient. To-morrow
we will know something.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” said Arlac, angrily, “you speak of patience
as though it were water or sand or anything
that is easy to have. What will you know to-morrow?
Sacré! Speak to us of food, if you please.
Bigre! We’re hungry I tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” growled others, “we starve. Let us die
fighting at any rate.”</p>

<p>Some of the more moderate wished to wait until
the dawn, that the men could sleep and so be fresh
against any new adversity on the morrow. Others
were for a rest until midnight and then a quick
march to the mainland; for we did not doubt that
we were on one of the many promontories which in
these parts jut up and down the coast for long distances.
For my part I asked nothing better than
to move quickly, to the northward, or westward or
which ever way would bring us soonest to our journey’s
ending. So, at midnight we set forth again,
the men moving uncomplaining.</p>

<p>By four of the morning, it being still dark, those
of the company who were in advance came to a
sudden halt. In a moment we were all at a standstill,
peering out into the darkness over a body of
water. It was a channel or sluice, through which
the tide was running strongly into the sea. The
line of the beach took a turn sharply to the left and
follow it as we might there was no chance to gain
our way to the mainland.</p>

<p>Across the channel from time to time we fancied
we could make out the twinkling of lights, small like
stars; but whether they were glow-flies or lights of
lanthorns or fires upon a distant beach we could not
discover. Men were at once set to work building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
large rafts out of small trees, upon which when day
dawned we might make our way across this channel.
Slowly the dawn came up out of the sea, and a faint
glow spread over the sky overhead, turning it to a
color deep and fathomless. One by one the lines of
foam on the bar came out of the darkness until the
sea was dark against the lightening sky and the stars
grew fainter in the glow of coming day. It was cool
and frosty—the freshness of something new begun,
and the dry grasses behind us were trembling together
in the morning breeze. Never did the spur
of new-born day find such ready response. For the
blithe Frenchmen, hungry as they were, answering
readily to the crisp call of the dawn, set about putting
their weapons to rights and gathered together
in their companies in fine fettle.</p>

<p>By and by we could plainly see the low-lying
beach of a shore not far distant across the channel.
We seemed on a kind of cape or sand-spit, for the
bay lay far around to the left and was lost in the
angle of the sand dunes. There were sand dunes
there, across this channel, in plenty too and bushes
and hills higher than those we had passed. The
sergeant-major, La Caille, the Chevalier de Brésac,
and Bachasse came and stood by me, waiting until we
could clearly make out the line of the coast.</p>

<p>Presently, upon a hill, outlined clear against the
sky, his arquebus upon his shoulder and his breastpieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and helmet catching the first glint of the
morning light, a soldier appeared. I fancied that
my mind had played my eyes some trick. But the
sergeant-major saw him at the same time; and in a
moment there followed two, three, five figures who
stood besides the first one pointing at us and waving
their arms.</p>

<p>Were they friends or enemies—Protestants or
Catholics? I strained my eyes to find in their garb
or manner some familiar sign.</p>

<p>We had not long to wait, for in a moment other
soldiers appeared from behind the hills and out on
the air there floated the ominous standard of Spain.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />
<small>TRUCE.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">La Caille started and his cry was echoed
from one end of the camp to the other. Officers
and men, aroused by the commotion, started up, seizing
their weapons, running here and there in bewilderment.
The trumpets blared and there was a clanking
of steel as the sick and starving men gladly arrayed
themselves in the ranks of battle. Ribault, aroused
for the moment by the martial sounds and sights,
marched before the company, his eyes flashing and his
sword bare, giving orders in so inspiring a way that
the men took great heart and stood strong and reliant.
The arquebusiers loaded their pieces and at
an order from their captains, marched down the
beach to the end of the sand-spit opposite the Spaniards,
where they grounded their arms and waited.</p>

<p>But regardless of this warlike show upon our part,
the Spaniards made no move to show their numbers
or intentions. Many more men appeared upon the
hills and others to the number of three-score or more
came out of the bushy hollows between the sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
dunes and stood unconcerned looking across at us.
There seemed something portentous in this calmness
and confidence, and this notion of mine was not
quieted by the subsequent actions of the Spanish
officers. For three or four of them came upon the
beach and arm in arm walked calmly up and down,
talking together, while their men sat themselves
upon the ground and ate their morning meal.</p>

<p>This calmness of the enemy had its effect upon the
companies of the Frenchmen. We could easily see
that, sick, hungry and weak as we were, our men
could prove no match for these hardy Biscayans,
with the confidence born of full bellies and continued
good fortune. Our men stood nervously, their
hands to their waistbands and their eyes starting
from their sunken sockets as they saw these gluttons
across the channel contentedly munch their biscuits
and drink some steaming stuff which was brought
them in a great iron pot from the camp among the
hills. The hunger, which during the two days had
been reduced to a dull gnawing at the vitals and a
general weakness of mind and body, now at the sight
of this steaming potage, suddenly became most keen
and poignant. As I looked, my mouth opened and
my tongue came out from my lips. “Ventre
bleu!” shouted De Brésac. “They tantalize us.
It is not to be borne.”</p>

<p>Job Goddard, who was one of my company of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
seamen, made no concealment of his suffering, and
leaned upon his pike with both hands, craning his
neck, his mouth and eyes wide distended. Then
without a word—which was the surer sign of his
madness—and without changing his gaze or expression,
he threw down his weapon and walked forward
out of the ranks, down the beach toward the Spaniards,
and into the water until the surface rose over
his head. None among us had a notion of his intention
until he came up sputtering, for he could not
swim, drifting seaward with the tide. He must
surely have been drowned had not one of the company
fastened upon him from one of the rafts with
a boat-hook.</p>

<p>Ribault then set the men at rest and called a conference
of the officers, at which it was quickly decided
to raise a white flag and call for a parley with those
in authority among the Spaniards. A white shirt
was thereupon fastened to a staff, and La Caille, the
sergeant-major, went out upon a raft in plain sight
of the enemy, waving this standard to and fro.
Presently an officer emerged from the bushes on the
other shore, replying. Then La Caille raising his
voice so that it echoed plainly among the distant
sand hills, shouted,</p>

<p>“We are Frenchmen,—company of Jean Ribault,
Admiral of France. If you would parley, send an
envoy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a pause before the answer came. In
our ranks, so great was the interest, no word was
spoken.</p>

<p>Then we heard in a harsh, commanding voice,</p>

<p>“You have a raft. Come yourselves!”</p>

<p>But the raft would have been of little avail in the
current of this channel. So Brunel, the valiant
swimmer who had gone first ashore from the <i>Trinity</i>,
swam quickly to the opposite side, and seeing a canoe
which lay there, entered it and paddled back to us
unmolested. La Caille presently returned with him
to the Spaniards as an envoy from the Admiral. We
saw La Caille, who feared nothing, directly approach
a group of the officers among the bushes, whom we
could make out by reason of the swords they carried.
These he saluted, and one in a cloak arose and acknowledged
him courteously. Then he sat down
and talked with them.</p>

<p>Ribault meanwhile had gone back among the dunes,
where many of those most religiously inclined had
fallen upon their knees in prayer. It was not proper
that he should have left the front of his command
when a mission so delicate as this was trembling in
the balance. It is not my desire to belittle the use
of prayer at any time; since, if meet and fitting, such
petitions are frequently heard, and the great God is
very good. But it was little like this gallant man to
give a public sign of his doubts to cope with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
questions or adversaries. And such, perhaps, a
prayer would not have been had not all his actions
since the wrecking of the <i>Trinity</i> shown a
timidity unaccountable. A great gloom had fallen
upon those petitioners, but there were few of us who
had not come under its ban. By and by they sang
a hymn. The melancholy cadences rolled and echoed
from one sand hill to another, until the sound sunk
deep into our souls and made us weak and womanish.
So dispirited were my men that I perforce
gave out a few sharp orders of discipline, and so set
them to rights.</p>

<p>The face of La Caille wore no great signs of encouragement
as he returned. The Admiral met him
upon the beach as the canoe touched the shore.</p>

<p>“Is it——?” he began.</p>

<p>“It is Menendez de Avilés, the Adelantado,” said
La Caille gravely.</p>

<p>“And his force?”</p>

<p>“Many hundreds, I should judge, your Excellency;
so disposed that progress in this direction is
impossible.”</p>

<p>Ribault put his hand to his brow as though a great
pain were at his temples. “I thought as much,” he
said.</p>

<p>La Caille went on. “I am bidden tell your Excellency
that if you should desire to speak with this
Spaniard you may go with four or six companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and he pledges his word you shall come back
safe.”</p>

<p>Ribault was in a great ferment of spirit. But he
could not doubt that what the sergeant-major said
was true, and so he called the Ensign Arlac, the
Sieur de la Notte and myself, who with La Caille,
De Brésac and one other entered the canoe and paddled
to the opposite shore.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon our approach Menendez de Avilés arose,
and with two officers and a priest walked down upon
the beach to meet us. He stood very erect and bore
his hand lightly upon the hilt of his sword. A black
cloak thrown around his shoulders half hid his
mouth and chin, but for all that I could mark the
sinister smile and cruel lips, the sight of which had
been burnt into my memory as I lay weak and helpless
in the dungeon at Dieppe. His chaplain, De Solis,
was at his heels. The officers were not ill-favored,
only servile and full of fear of him. All four bowed
low, doffing their morions and sweeping them to the
Admiral, who acknowledged the courtesy in kind.
Many compliments upon the reputation of each of
these men were passed by the other, and it might
have been thought that they were rather new-found
friends than the deadliest enemies of their generation
in this poor world.</p>

<p>De Avilés came well prepared to treat with starving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
men. He led us up to the bushes and bidding
us be seated, caused wine and preserved fruits to be
placed before us. Though it had seemed I had no
mind to eat, we all partook of these things with
great avidity. Were there great events to come, it
were better, I thought, to borrow strength to meet
them. There was little said; Ribault addressed
to the Adelantado a few questions, yet these were
for the most part unimportant. The silence of La
Caille and the others was that of hungry men and
not to be mistaken for fear or intimidation. I was
using my eyes to as good an advantage as my teeth
and let them travel from one bush and hummock
to another, seeking to discover, if possible, more than
La Caille of their disposition and force. Yet look
as I might, everywhere did I see a breast-piece,
morion, pike or arquebus. The bushes seemed
fairly alive with soldiery and at least an hundred
and fifty men were in plain sight from where we sat
upon the sand. If this were but an advance guard,
or escort from the army of Menendez, then surely
the half-starved, illy-armed, dispirited three hundred
and fifty cavaliers, seamen, soldiers and tinkers
of Admiral Ribault had scant chance of fighting a
victorious battle here or otherwhere.</p>

<p>Though I looked much at the scenes and persons
about me, my eyes would ever return to a low lying
bush some fifty feet away upon a sand dune. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in its shadow was a human leg, booted, the toe of
which extended partly out into the sunlight. I
thought it at first the member of some tired fellow
asleep and so gave it no thought. But my gaze
came back upon that foot with a sinister persistency.
For follow the line of the leg into the shadow as I
would I could find no companion to it, nor yet a
body. It ended with horrid abruptness half above
the knee.</p>

<p>Menendez de Avilés abruptly broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Captain Juan Ribao,” he said with an air of command
which jarred strangely upon his courteous demeanor,
“further subterfuge between us were now
a sin and a lie before the face of God our Lord.
Are you Catholics or Lutherans?”</p>

<p>“We are Lutherans of the New Faith,” returned
Ribault, staunchly.</p>

<p>The Spaniard sucked in a long breath between his
teeth.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, your fort is taken and in it all are
put to the sword.”</p>

<p>He spat the words out mercilessly and hatefully.</p>

<p>There was a dreadful stillness, and then we
started up with one accord, looking around from the
one to the other. The Sieur de la Notte tried to
speak, but the words would not come forth from his
throat, at which he clutched and would have gone to
the ground had he not fallen back into my arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
The Admiral was bewildered. La Caille, only, did
not tremble. He stood up, straight and fearless.</p>

<p>“Señor Pedro Menendez de Avilés,” he said
calmly and distinctly, “it is my belief that you lie.”</p>

<p>Menendez seized his sword at this insult and the
Spanish officers rushed forward. They thought
surely the Adelantado would run the valiant Frenchman
through the body.</p>

<p>But the devil was not ready yet. It was too
pleasant a torture to have been ended so soon. He
thrust his sword back until it rung in the scabbard
and folded his arms, laughing.</p>

<p>“You wish proofs,” he then said quickly. “Very
well, you shall have them!”</p>

<p>And going to the edge of the bushes he gave some
orders, while we stood horror-stricken. In a while
came three soldiers bringing some weapons and a
sack. Arlac the Ensign, with a look of dismay upon
his face, seized upon a sword which was thrust toward
him.</p>

<p>“Par la bonté de Dieu,” he cried. “It is La
Vigne’s very own!”</p>

<p>And then we saw dishes and platters bearing the
Arms of Réné de Laudonnière, two axes, dark-stained
and broken at the handle, but bearing the
name of a maker of Dieppe, a canteen, a cross-bow—all
of which were known of De Brésac and La Caille.
I pray that never again may any man upon the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
be given such sufferings of mind as began for me
from that moment.</p>

<p>Diane—Diane!——</p>

<p>No, no, I would not believe it! The Sieur de la
Notte, who had been looking vacantly from La Caille
to Arlac the Ensign, fell heavily to the beach uttering
a moan which sounded more like that of some
poor beast than of a man. I thought that he was
dead. He made no move though we dashed water
at his head again and again. At last his breathing
came with difficulty and when some wine had been
poured down his throat he lifted his head and tried
to speak.</p>

<p>“Señor Adelantado,” he cried, trembling and halting
at every word,—at the terror of uttering it,—“my
daughter—Diane—Diane de la Notte—she is
not—dead—dead. For the love of God—say that—she
is not—dead!” And the love he bore her in
that speech welded his soul and mine so tight together
that not even death could draw us apart.</p>

<p>But the Adelantado would give no answer, only
standing there with folded arms gloating upon our
misfortune like some great snake upraised to strike,
yet sure of his prey and charming by his venomousness.
Surely it was the very perfection of cruelty;
for the old man lifted himself to a sitting posture
with both hands upraised and then fell back upon
the sand making no sound. Lifting the poor gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in my arms I carried him down the beach to
the canoe, where I laid him upon a boat-cloak.</p>

<p>But that was not all. Fearful of some new discovery,
yet bewitched and trusting in the word of
this Spaniard we followed him and his officers up
the beach. One horror but waited upon another.
The Spaniards made no concealment of it, and now
I knew the reason of the dread horror that had hung
upon me. Not only did I see dismembered human
legs, half covered with sand, but here and there a
body bearing no longer any human semblance. The
Adelantado walked a little in advance, swerving
neither to the right nor to the left for the dreadful
things which his boots frequently touched, regardless,—familiar.
Once he stumbled in the sand and
cursing, like to have fallen as he uncovered a human
head which rolled over until it sat upon its neck, the
beard spreading out fan-wise upon the sand and the
face through the matted hair grinning fiercely.
Arlac and the Admiral, being in front, fell back
shuddering, turning whiter even than the sand and
holding each other by the arms. I looked at the
dreadful object and my blood turned to water. The
thing was Verdier!</p>

<p>The Admiral would now go no further, saying
that he had seen enough and wished only to go away
from it all. But Menendez, in great good humor,
smiled, saying it were better to see and know all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that could be known. And we believed him. We
were heedless of treachery—or aught else, for it
seemed to matter little now whether we lived or died,
and there was a horrible fascination which seemed to
lead us on in spite of ourselves. And so we followed,
trembling.</p>

<p>We had gone a distance of a gunshot or more
from the end of the sand-spit when we came to two
sand hills larger than those we had passed. They
lay in two curves, the one toward the other, making
an enclosed place which at the two entrances and on
the sides was thickly grown up with grass and bushes.
To the nearest of these entrances Menendez led us,
then stopped and turning grimly to the Admiral,</p>

<p>“Here, Juan Ribao,” he said, “is the company of
the <i>Gloire</i>!”</p>

<p>And entering by the pathway he motioned us to
follow.</p>

<p>But a terror had fallen upon us as at the dread of
something supernatural. There was no wind and a
silence heavy and oppressive hung about the place,
the more appalling for the distant roar of the waves
upon the beach.</p>

<p>Overhead high in the sky several vultures were idly
wheeling. I looked at the faces of the others. La
Caille was livid, but his jaw was set and his eye was
glassy like that of the dead. Arlac was white as
marble, and hung upon me cold and nerveless. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Admiral had clasped his hands together before him
and bent his head to his breast. His eyes were
closed. He was praying.</p>

<p>For myself I seemed to have no further fear or
dread, only a curiosity which fascinated. Leaving
Arlac, I walked forward with La Caille and entered.
At first I could see nothing, for bushes grew about
the place. And God’s pure sand, which had unwillingly
drunk up the blood of this reeking sacrifice, had
mercifully blown in upon it and tenderly made a
white coverlet here and there which hid the freshness
of the barbarity.</p>

<p>I halt at the horror of it, and I cannot write more
of the scene. It is enough to say that the men of
the <i>Gloire’s</i> company had been led to this place in
small parties, their hands bound behind their backs
with the match-cords of their own arquebuses.
Menendez de Avilés with his cane had drawn a line
across the entrance. When they had passed within
they were set upon by these savage people like tigers
and, defenseless, were slaughtered like sheep. They
were about two hundred in number and of these not
one was left alive. Menendez told us these things
calmly, as one who recites that of which he has been
told.</p>

<p>Then he turned once more to the Admiral, saying
somewhat softly as though to atone a little in our
eyes for the deeds he had acknowledged, “It is sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that human beings should be enemies and I would
not pursue war relentlessly. But I believe that this
is a just fate for all heretics. All Catholics I will befriend;
but as you are of the New Sect, I hold you
as enemies, and wage deadly war against you. And
this I will do with all cruelty (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">crueldad</i>) in this
country, where I command as Viceroy and Captain-General
for my King. I am here to plant the Holy
Gospel, that the Indians may be enlightened and
come to a knowledge of the faith.”</p>

<p>The Admiral made no reply and so he turned back
and we followed him.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />
<small>THE LINE UPON THE SAND.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">As I write, the memory of these scenes comes
back to me as if the years that are gone
were but as yesterday. There is much that is too
dreadful to set down and the things of which I
speak are told only in order that they may be truthfully
known of all honest men of whatever creed or
faith. I am told that the artist Le Moyne has related
much that happened at Fort Caroline and, as I have
said, Nicholas Challeux, the carpenter, has added
more. But saving the short story of Christophe Le
Breton, there is nothing to my knowledge written
down by any survivor from the wrecked vessels of
the French fleet. And though the acts of one generation,
or indeed a shorter period, may not be lightly
judged by another, it can be truthfully said that no
deeds of savagery among heathen peoples have
ever surpassed those of Menendez for blood-letting
and ferocity. It has been told me that the Indians
of Outina, seeing in this Spaniard a cruelty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
murder-love more marvelous than anything they
themselves had known or dreamed, fell straightway
to worshiping him as a god, aiding him in his
devilries and hanging upon his orders with a greater
devotion than that displayed by his own men.
Whether this be true or not I do not know. I can
better relate the things of which I was a witness.</p>

<p>When we came back to the landing-place the
Admiral had succeeded in mastering his despair.</p>

<p>The Spaniard, Menendez, his hand upon his sword
hilt listened to him coldly:</p>

<p>“We are wrecked upon this barren shore,” Ribault
was saying. “A death from hunger threatens more
even than your pikes and ordnance. We can only
throw ourselves on your pity. What has befallen
us may one day befall you.”</p>

<p>“That were indeed a misfortune,” replied De
Avilés.</p>

<p>“I beseech you,” continued Ribault, “in the
name of the friendship between the Kings of France
and Spain, who are brothers and close friends, to
aid me in conveying my followers home.”</p>

<p>Menendez paused a while. Then he said, slowly
and deliberately, “Of that I cannot say. If you will
give up your arms and banners and place yourselves
at my mercy, you may do so; and I will act towards
you as God shall give me grace.”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> “—si ellos quieren entregarle las Vanderas, é las Armas, é ponerse
en su Misericordia, lo pueden hacer, para que el haga de ellos
lo que Dios le diere de Gratia.”—The words of De Solis, the brother-in-law
of Menendez.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p></div>

<p>“I cannot be sure my followers will do that,”
returned the Admiral, “but there is little doubt
that under this promise the greater part of my
officers and men will surrender upon these terms
as honorable prisoners of war. With your permission
I will return and consult with those in command
upon the other shore.”</p>

<p>“Do as you will. Other than this you can have
neither truce nor friendship with me.” His manner
after this was more cordial than before and left a
good impression upon our minds.</p>

<p>With formal salutations on both sides, we returned
to the canoe. As we were conveyed to our
comrades upon the other shore the Sieur de la Notte
lay against my knee, conscious, but more dead with
grief than alive. I could say little save that I
thought Mademoiselle was still living; but I could
not tell why, and he took no comfort.</p>

<p>In spite of the sights we had seen and the massacre
of the company of the <i>Gloire</i> it was plain to all
who had heard him that the words and manner of
Menendez contained an assurance of protection for
such of us as would surrender; but few were in a
mood to give up without a battle.</p>

<p>The horror which hung over us and the tidings
of the fall of Fort Caroline had unnerved me. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the absence of Diego de Baçan I took for a favorable
augury, and fancied that perhaps Mademoiselle
had escaped to Satouriona and that De Baçan was
searching for her. I knew that not all at Fort
Caroline had been killed, for one of the officers had
said as much. I could not believe Mademoiselle
dead, for, that being so, I felt that some instinct
should tell me of it and I should have no further
wish for life. But back upon the shore my love of
life returned to me tenfold. I wished to live to
find Mademoiselle, and would perform any feat or
strategy to save her and carry her back with me to
England. If she were alive, my death would not
help her; if she were dead, then my own life could
be given in no better cause than in taking satisfaction
against him who had slain her.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to decide. Whether to
stay upon the sand-spit to die of hunger or at the
hands of the Indians, or to surrender to Menendez
and be sent for life to the galleys, I could not determine.
Either plan promised little enough. In
the one case I was not sure that communication
with the interior could be found, for dangerous
swamps and quicksands ran this way and that,
making progress almost impossible; and starvation
was imminent. Before we could come to the
domain of Satouriona there were miles of hostile
country, the traversing of which would take many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
weeks, perhaps months. To surrender seemed
equally desperate. We had seen the deeds of which
this madman was capable; and in spite of his word
of honor, which holds high among men of authority,
and which he now wished to give under seal, his
humor might change and our fate be that of those
who had gone before. But by the one plan I could
not hear of Mademoiselle for months; by the other
I would be carried straightway to San Augustin by
our enemies, and might see her within the week.
The thought enthralled me.</p>

<p>By some ruse and skill I would effect her escape.
De Baçan probably thought me dead; and unless
Mademoiselle had told him, could not know that I
was of this expedition. And the beard which had
grown upon my face might well disguise me; so
that until I was prepared to meet him on equal
footing I would not let my presence be known.</p>

<p>In a little while the Admiral sent another messenger
across the water offering a ransom of an hundred
thousand ducats, and the answer which came back
encouraged us much more. He would accept the
ransom, he said, “it would much grieve him not to
do so, for he had great need of it.” I felt that I
could not do better than to become a captive, and
so win my way most quietly to where the prisoners
of Fort Caroline were confined.</p>

<p>Toward evening, the sun being about an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
from setting, the Admiral mounted upon a hummock
of sand and addressed his desperate little army
in the following terms:</p>

<p>“You have heard, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mes braves</i>, of the conditions
which this Spanish general has set before us. Those
among you who will render up your arms and surrender
in peace, he will accept as honorable prisoners
of war, to be done with as he shall deem most fitting.
You have heard of the massacre of your comrades
of the <i>Gloire</i> and must be the judge of your own
actions. I would force no man to surrender against
his will without a battle; but I do believe in the
promises which now have been made to me by word
of mouth and by writ. For no man professing any
sort of religion, as this Spaniard does, were so hideous
as to fall upon unarmed men after a given word
which has put them in his power.”</p>

<p>There was a murmur among the seamen and several
of them raised their voices, shouting,</p>

<p>“But he has done so! He has done so!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,—my friends. I could not learn from
the Spaniard how your comrades of the <i>Gloire</i> came
to fall into his hands. But I cannot believe that he
promised to them what he has promised me to-day.
I have it from him in a writing which he has
signed and sealed, and which he has sent me of his
own free will; and I believe that he will keep these
promises. On the morrow I shall surrender myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to him as an honorable prisoner of war to be sent to
Spain, and by the grace of God, perhaps soon released.”</p>

<p>This last statement of the Admiral’s position raised
a great hue-and-cry among the company, and many
of them shouted loudly.</p>

<p>“No, we will not go! We will not surrender!”
Others were silent, waiting for the Admiral to finish.
He stood there upon the sand-hill, his tall figure
straight as a spar, outlined sharp and clear against
the western glow. His hands were clasped before
him, a position in which we had often found him of
late, and he waited composed until the strife should
cease.</p>

<p>“My friends,” he said at last, and a deep and
solemn silence fell around us, “we are in the hands
of God. We have done what it has pleased Him to
permit us to do toward building up in this great
country the Church of Christ according to our religion.
We have been pursued by every misfortune
possible, and yet our faith in Him should not diminish
one jot.”</p>

<p>“Amen! Amen!” murmured many with deep
reverence.</p>

<p>Then the Admiral walked down from the hummock
towards the ocean, drawing with his sword as
he went,—<a href="#image03">a line in the sand</a>! Then raising his hand,
he said,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<a name="image03" id="image03">
  <img src="images/image03.jpg" width="378" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_170">“<span class="smcap">A line in the sand!</span>”</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“To-morrow morning, my friends, I shall surrender.
All of those who will accompany me will follow
over upon the hither side of this line which I have
marked. I make no compulsion. Those others of
you who will not come must pass to the farther side.”
And so saying he walked over to the side of the line
toward the Spanish camp.</p>

<p>It was a supreme moment. That mark in the sand
which the winds and seas could sweep away at will
seemed the dividing line between life and death,
and none knew which side to choose. Not even a
whisper came from the men, and the droning of the
surf as it rolled in on the beach seemed ominous
and loud in the stillness.</p>

<p>After a period of suspense which seemed interminable
an old man with a gray beard, bowing his head as
though in submission to a will over which he had no
control, gathered his cloak about him and walked to
where stood the Admiral. Bordelais followed. Then
Arlac and three seamen passed to the opposite side.
Bachasse, dutiful as ever, followed his captain, together
with Ottigny and others to the number of
ten. But many more moved to the opposite side.
It was like a game. For, until the matter was settled,
no man spoke. They came from the crowd in twos
and threes, gravely until they reached their companions,
when some of them patted the others upon the
back, saying quietly, but with good cheer,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“We sink or swim together, mes gars!”</p>

<p>“There will at least be a fine fight, eh?”</p>

<p>“We are not yet ready for the sheep-market, mon
Amiral!”</p>

<p>“There is still good wine to be drunk in San
Augustin, and we’ve good use for our windpipes.”</p>

<p>And many other rude jests which reached only the
ears of La Caille, De Brésac, myself and those few
who were standing by them. For a moment I wavered.
There was something much after my own
heart in the way these brave fellows defied this
Menendez, casting themselves out into the wilderness
of forest and swamp where death would certainly
find them. They had a fighting chance and
La Caille, De Brésac and I would have gone with
them; but I knew that the surer way to Mademoiselle
was that which I had chosen, and so I wavered
not for long.</p>

<p>By the time the sun was down the matter was
settled, but few still standing aloof. About two
hundred officers and men had gone to the further
side, refusing to surrender, and were now forming
into some kind of martial order under Arlac, a sea-lieutenant
named Pierre Le Jeune and another
called D’Alençon. The remainder, among them the
Sieur de la Notte, La Caille, De Brésac, Bourdelais,
Bachasse, Ottigny, Job Goddard, Salvation Smith,
myself and many other soldiers and gentlemen as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
well as seamen, to the number of about one hundred
and fifty, stood on the side of the Admiral.</p>

<p>With the vain hope that one of the French ships
might yet appear unharmed to take us off, the
Admiral determined to wait until the morning before
crossing the channel, and so informed Menendez
de Avilés by messenger.</p>

<p>The night fell chill and gusty, for it was well into
the middle of October. That last night we remained
together, those of one party sending messages by
those of the other to any refugees from Fort Caroline
who might be discovered, or friends in France
whom they might not see again. Huge fires were
lit upon the beach in order that any vessels sailing
on the coast might see us and come to the rescue.
Around these we sat or lay, some of us sleeping but
most of us waking—until the dawn. When the
stars began to pale a little, Le Jeune, Arlac and
D’Alençon got their men in motion, taking as many
arms with them as was needful, and marched down
the beach in the direction from which we had come.
And that was the last I saw of them.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />
<small>THE MARTYRDOM.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">The morning of that dreadful day dawned cold
and clear. In the east over the ocean the
sky was bright and glorious as though the heavens
were opening. But scan the sea as we might, not
a sail appeared and all hope of thus saving ourselves
from imprisonment was gone.</p>

<p>When the company of Arlac had disappeared
around the point a league or so away to the southward,
the Admiral arose from where he had been
lying upon the beach by one of the fires and, calling
about him those who would come, knelt down upon
the sand and fervently prayed for the safety of those
who had been spared until that day. Then rising
he went down the beach and with La Caille, Bourdelais
and myself, entered the canoe and we were
rowed rapidly to the other shore. The Admiral, in
order to keep his part of the compact with De
Avilés, carried with him the royal standard and other
flags, his sword, dagger, helmet, buckler and the
official seal given him by Coligny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Menendez, upon our approach, arose and stood
waiting for the Admiral to speak.</p>

<p>“I have come in behalf of myself and one hundred
and fifty persons of my command to surrender as
honorable prisoners of war. I have brought these
standards and my personal arms and seal in token
of the good faith which shall therefore bear equally
between us.”</p>

<p>Menendez motioned to one of his officers, who
took from the hands of La Caille and me these
things which we had brought.</p>

<p>“Two hundred of your men,” said the Spaniard,
“have retreated from their position and I will wage
a war against them with blood and fire. And you I
shall treat as our Lord shall inspire.”</p>

<p>Calling to some of his soldiers, he directed two
of them to enter the canoe and bring over the
Frenchmen, who stood waiting upon the opposite
bank. It seemed that they were to come in companies
of ten and, as they arrived, would be made
prisoners by an equal number of the Spanish soldiers
and led toward San Augustin.</p>

<p>Then Menendez came again to where we stood at
the edge of the bushes. He was surrounded by a
number of his soldiers and he motioned to us to
move behind the sand-hills; this, unsuspecting, we
did, out of sight of the other shore.</p>

<p>Then for the first time I took notice of the face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the Adelantado. If it were hard and cruel of ordinary,
the look it now wore was like nothing so much
as that of a wild beast; his under jaw and lip projected
hideously, but under the brows, in spite of
their ferocity, there was the gleam of intelligence
and cunning which made the whole expression the
more sinister and dreadful. He came close to the
Admiral, looking him in the face:—</p>

<p>“Juan Ribao,” he said, “you and all of your company
are now in my power, and I shall do with you—<em>as
God shall give me grace</em>!”</p>

<p>As God should give him grace! I looked around
me at the bearded faces of the soldiery, who were
now closing in upon us, and the menace of those
words,—the very same that he had uttered in his
promise of yesterday,—first dawned upon me with
its terrible meaning.</p>

<p>The Admiral looked him in the eyes, still unknowing.
“I am ready to go with you,” he replied calmly.</p>

<p>But two soldiers came up from behind, seizing his
arms and then—and not till then—the scales fell
from the eyes of all of us and we saw that we had
been duped,—trapped, by this arch fiend and traitor.</p>

<p>La Caille and I exchanged glances and turning
about made one desperate spring for liberty. La
Caille fell full upon the point of a pike and so died,
making not even an outcry. A sword scratched my
arm and I pitched upon the figure of the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
wielded it. The sword flew from his hand, but his
arms closed about me tightly and over and over we
rolled among the bushes, the soldiers dodging about
trying to get their weapons home upon my body,
but fearing to hurt their fellow. He was strong and
I weak from lack of food; in a few moments he
had me undermost, while he was striving to draw a
poniard. Another man here fell upon my legs,
while still another was running forward with a partisan.</p>

<p>I gave myself up for lost. Hoping to warn
those who had not yet been conveyed across the
channel, I let forth a loud cry. Then my adversary
leaned down on me, clapping his hand across my
mouth. I bit into his finger fiercely and thought
the dagger was coming down.</p>

<p>But I saw his face at the same moment that he
saw mine; and knew why I had been so easily overcome,
for it was Don Diego de Baçan! I watched
the point of the dagger; but it did not fall. His
surprise was so great that his hand remained suspended
in mid-air, and he drew in a quick breath of
fright as though he had seen a phantom. His soldiers,
noting his discomfiture, did not strike, but
stood waiting. In a moment a knowledge of the
truth came to him.</p>

<p>Then, perhaps in a spirit of fair play, remembering
a time when I had set him free, he lowered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
weapon and bade his men bind and gag me and set
me on my feet.</p>

<p>He stood in front of me holding his sides, alternately
laughing and sucking his bitten finger.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Sir Pirato, the dead hath come to life
of a verity. And this is no miracle but a clear process
of reasoning. It would have grieved me much
to see thee die just now, for I have rarely met a man
of such honest thews. It doth me good to see thy
face again. Though by my conscience I have always
sworn that I like not a beard upon the countenance
of Englishmen, which to my mind should ever
be round and hairless like the sucklings that they
are.”</p>

<p>I listened composedly to his banter, glad of the
chance to rid my mind of the horror which was to
come.</p>

<p>“It is a pity, my fledgling cock, that Mademoiselle
de la Notte did not inform me—ah! you start.
Yes, yes, she lives—in very excellent health and
would have bidden you farewell, had she known.
She will mourn when you’re dead, Sir Pirato, for she
thinks of you with great kindness.” And so he
went on adding one insult to another, veiling them
under this thin coating of humor, so that they might
cut the deeper. But I saw from his surprise and
from the manner in which he spoke that Mademoiselle
had told him nothing. He was lying in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
throat. If she were alive she was safe also from him—that
I knew. But I trembled with rage at his manner
and innuendos and would have killed him if
I could. I remembered the chance I had upon
the <i>Cristobal</i> and felt accursed for having let such
a thing as he continue to live upon the earth. I saw
him go over to the Adelantado and talk earnestly,
pointing toward me as though asking some favor.
The Adelantado shook his head in refusal, but at
last wavering, seemed to give assent.</p>

<p>The safety of Mademoiselle was first in my
thoughts and made me almost happy as I stood
there, though for myself there seemed little chance
that I should come out of the adventure alive. De
Baçan had won, it seemed. If there were a chance
of escape I should not be slow to take it; but if I
were to die I would show no white feather to this
Spaniard whom I hated,—and now hate, even that
he is dead, as I think no man was ever hated
before.</p>

<p>My comrades of the <i>Trinity</i> gave no sign of fear,
though they felt the nearness of their doom as keen
as I. The Admiral stood erect, his head high in
air. Bourdelais had been pinioned and bound, and
stood near his chief, helpless but determined that
no supplication for pity should escape his lips. My
heart went out to the Sieur de la Notte, for he was
white as death and so weak that two soldiers carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
him. His livid, delicate face looked this way and
that as though his mind wandered and were unconscious
of it all. I wanted to speak to him one last
word—to tell him that Mademoiselle was alive and
might be among the people of Satouriona; he
might have died happy. The pity of it! But I
could not, for my mouth was bandaged tightly and
it was impossible for me to make a sound above a
murmur.</p>

<p>At length all the Frenchmen of Ribault had come
upon this shore and stood or lay bound and helpless
among the sand-hills. Then Menendez de Avilés
came to Admiral Ribault and said again,</p>

<p>“Is there any one among you who will go to
confession?”</p>

<p>Ribault turned his head, closing his eyes and answered
calmly,</p>

<p>“I and all here are of the Reformed Faith.”</p>

<p>Then he looked upward as though making one
last mute appeal for the lives of the men whom he
had unwittingly led to this martyrdom. His face
shone with a new beauty as he gazed upward, and
the heavens smiled back at him. The brightness,
and glory of the day were wonderful, and that
made the contrast the stranger. It even seemed as
though the sun, the sea, the sky and all the wonders
of God’s earth and firmament were sullied and polluted
by the touch of these atrocities. There, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the lonely sand-spit in the hands of these fanatics,
we were forgotten of God.</p>

<p>Then Ribault raised his voice in a chant which
mingled softly with the roar of the surf and melted
into the air like the passing of a soul. It was the
Psalm “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domine memento mei</i>” and one by one the
Huguenots, some kneeling, but most standing upright,
fearlessly took it up until a great and holy
prayer went up to God. There was something
greater than the things of earth in that grand chorus,
and in the faces of these martyrs was the look
which must be borne by those already within the
gates of Paradise.</p>

<p>As I saw Menendez de Avilés and his butchers
come forward, closing in, two men took me from
the rear, dragging me behind a sand-hill, throwing
me upon the beach and tightly binding my feet and
legs with ropes and arquebus cords. They fastened
my handkerchief over the bandage upon my
mouth to make it the more secure, and passed this
closely over my ears so that now only sight remained
to me. But this assisted me little, for my
neck was bound so tight that I could not turn my
head. They threw me face downward upon the
sand and so left me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I lay there I know not how long, expecting each
moment to receive the point of a pike between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
shoulders. I have thanked God many times since
then that in those dreadful moments he made me
powerless to see and hear. So great was the agony
of mind that more than once I prayed that all might
soon be ended. The sufferings through which I was
passing had made me well-nigh distraught; but it
was only a temporary lunacy like that upon the
beach after the wreck. And I have come to this
day, at a ripe age, in full possession of all my
faculties. Death was not yet for me.</p>

<p>In a while there came two of these fiends reeking
and drunk with slaughter; unbinding my feet,
they bade me follow on behind their fellows who
had gone before toward San Augustin, carrying
their bloody trophies. The lives of four others
beside mine own had been spared; and we prisoners,—De
Brésac, a fifer, a drummer and a trumpeter
were tied together for our better security, and in
single line were marched up the beach. Each looked
at the heels of the man in front, fearing to raise his
eyes upon some new barbarity. Toward noon
there was a rest and these butchers fed us upon
biscuit and preserved fruits, giving each a draught of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau de vie</i>. It seemed from this that they meant for
the present to save us further physical suffering.
The drink set new life coursing through my veins,
and by afternoon I had steeled my memory in some
sort against the things which had been, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
prepared my spirit against the new and, like enough,
more desperate trials of mind and body which must
surely come.</p>

<p>For what else could De Baçan be saving me?
Was it for a torture worse than the death of Ribault,
La Notte and those other martyrs, my companions?
What hideous devilry could he be devising? I
thought of his sinister threat upon the <i>San Cristobal</i>,
and I felt sure he was preparing to work his worst
upon me. But even as I was,—helpless, in his
power,—I had no fear of him; only hatred, which
had driven out all other personal relation. There
was no instrument that the Inquisition had devised
which should provoke one groan, and no torture that
he could invent which should wring one tribute to
his devilish ingenuity. So long as Mademoiselle
were not there to make my pulses tremble, he should
have no sign. Nay, more,—I would escape. Mademoiselle
alive, let them give me so much as half a
hair’s breadth of license and I vowed that there were
not enough Spaniards in all the Flowery Land to
hold me a prisoner. And—why I knew not,—I
was as sure she was alive as though she were
there by my side. I would escape back to Europe
to let the King of France and our own Queen Bess of
England know what manner of fiends the King of
Spain had let loose, to make a living hell of this
great and good land across the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>It was right that I should escape. There were none
who were with Ribault when he was betrayed save me,
and none who could give the lie to the tales this Spaniard
Menendez would tell to his people and to the
people of France. I determined that if God willed,
I would be the instrument of justice upon them.
And if the iron helm of fate were entrusted to my
hands, I would seize it with no light grasp. For the
moment, even the thought of Mademoiselle and all
she had suffered and might still suffer vanished from
my mind, and I wished nothing but vengeance for
the murder of my comrades. I knew not until now
how dear they had been to me. <em>She</em> would understand.
She would know. They were of her religion;
but like me, she had not the humility to bow
meekly under such a blow. If I could first escape
out of their intimate clutches I knew that I could
get to France. There had been many ships on the
Florida coast of late—English ships too—and Admiral
Hawkins, or perhaps even Captain Hooper,
might now be in those waters.</p>

<p>And so my mind planned and planned, as I trudged
along toward San Augustin between the serried
ranks of my captors. There was no chance of escape,
for arquebusiers to the number of ten brought
up the rear, and De Baçan had given them orders to
shoot us in the back did we give the slightest sign
or movement of a nature suspicious. In this fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
we walked until dark, De Baçan saying no word nor
even coming near. Then we turned sharply through
the dunes in-shore to the left, and came abruptly to
the bay within the sand-spit and upon four large
barges which had been brought to convey us across
this arm of the sea.</p>

<p>It was not until then that I had a chance for
words with Diego de Baçan. I determined that
could I speak with him I would leave no effort of
diplomacy unmade to secure his attention and approval.
For this was no place for pride, and therein
lay the way to safety. It so happened that in the
boat his thwart was next to mine. With some display
of good humor he addressed me:—</p>

<p>“Gratitude may not be one of your virtues, Sir
Pirato.”</p>

<p>“I find little cause for gratitude, Don de Baçan,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Not even that you have your life as a gift from
the Adelantado? You are truly hard to please.
Here have I saved you from a long wait in the
bowels of hell, and you pay me with what?—not
even a smile of thanks or welcome.”</p>

<p>“Then it is to you I owe my life?”</p>

<p>“For the present, Señor Killigrew.”</p>

<p>“And why have you spared me?”</p>

<p>“I know not. A whim, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“A happy whim for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Be not so sure of that, my bantam. I fancied you
dead long since, you see, in spite of the Señorita La
Notte. There was something of surprise that made
me spare you the dagger—something of curiosity
that made me beg your life of the Captain General—curiosity
to see in what way it were best to kill
men like you who die hard.”</p>

<p>“We can die but once,” I returned doggedly.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure. You don’t die easy, my master.
And you own such fine tough sinews it were
a pity to have you foisted off upon the devil with
such small display of resistance.”</p>

<p>“It is the torture then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It will be, my friend, as the Adelantado shall
decide. I have a fancy that in a short time thou wilt
become a valiant servant of the Church. I have
known a heretic rabid as thyself, turn speedily
Christian at the stake.”</p>

<p>“Fire is a very excellent servant of the devil,” I
returned, and so warmly that I regretted my petulance
the moment after.</p>

<p>“Ah, you think I may not bend your spirit!
Wait and see. Why, in our army we have a little
soldier so skilful in mechanical toys that he can set
his touch upon each particular nerve in the body,
running his fingers over them as lightly as one would
play the lute.”</p>

<p>“It ill becomes a fine, big man like you,” I returned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
“a man who has little fear of aught upon
the earth, to trifle with these petty contrivances.”
I thought I would try him upon a new course.</p>

<p>“My muscles, like yours, are good enough for
most of the purposes of this life; but with careful
feeding you might best me again. You see, I
acknowledge you. Nay, my bantam, you cannot
again touch my vanity. I fight you no more.”</p>

<p>“You will not fight me in your own camp?” said
I, unwilling to drop the question so easily. “Surely,
there will be little danger to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Who spoke of danger?” he said irritably, and
then laughing, “Ha! ha! I fear no danger. Why
should I fight you? I can see my soldiers take your
spirit out by slow inches. And I will view the spectacle
with great serenity—in company with a lady of
your acquaintance who has been pleased——”</p>

<p>“You devil!” I cried, unable to restrain myself.
“You liar and blasphemer!” and with a leap I
hurled myself against him until he fell against the
gunwale, and we all but went overboard. I striking
at him with my bound hands and elbows. The boat
rocked from this side to that, and we seemed
like to capsize. Several men were striking at me
with boat-hooks and oars, and at length they
dragged me off and threw me down in the bottom
of the boat.</p>

<p>“As God lives—I will kill you now!” he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
fiercely; and rising he drew his dagger. But he
thought better of it before he touched me, for he
thrust the weapon back and sat quietly down on his
thwart.</p>

<p>“We will wait,” he said calmly.</p>

<p>Thus ended my diplomacy! What a fool I was;
perhaps every chance of escape was lost. That was
all there was of it. They would take us to the
camp at San Augustin and there kill us like dogs.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a><br />
<small>THE LODGE OF SELOY.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">At the landing-place we were met by a large concourse
of soldiers and priests, who crowded
about with waving flambeaux, shouting and bidding
the victors welcome. Then a half-dozen of the priests,
with De Solis, took position at the head of the
column and we marched toward the Lodge of Seloy,
the priests chanting the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> as we marched.
And when we had come to an open place, a chaplain
called Mendoza, who seemed a person of importance,—the
same who has since written of this
expedition,—came walking to meet the Adelantado,
holding forward a crucifix in his hand.</p>

<p>When Menendez de Avilés reached the spot where
the chaplain stood, he fell down upon his knees and
most of his followers with him and gave a thousand
thanks for his victory. Then Mendoza raised his
voice and said, “We owe to God and His mother,
more than to human strength, this victory over the
adversaries of the holy Catholic religion. The greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
profit of this victory is the triumph which our Lord
has granted us, whereby His holy Gospel will be
introduced into this country, a thing so needful for
saving so many souls from perdition.”<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Mendoza’s Journal.</p></div>

<p>What a dreadful sacrilege it seemed that these
brutal men, dripping yet with the blood of human
creatures they had put to death, should call upon
their God in thanksgiving, asking Him to be an
accomplice in the murders they had done!</p>

<p>By and by we were taken to the great Lodge of
Seloy, which had been converted into a general
council chamber and meeting-place. It was a huge
barn-like structure, strongly framed of entire trunks
of trees and thatched with palmetto leaves. Around
it, entrenchments and fascines of sand had been
thrown up so that it was very capable of defense.
In one corner of this place there was a small cabin,
used as a dungeon; it had a door leading out to the
square and another leading into the large hall. But
there were no windows, the light coming in the daytime
from an aperture in the roof and in the night
from a fire burning on the sandy floor. They threw
us upon some cots of bark and skins and mounted a
guard of three soldiers over us—far too many, I
thought, since we were tightly bound.</p>

<p>I looked about me, along the sides, trying to
pierce the duskiness, which a torch and the burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
fire dimly served to lighten, to get my bearings in
case any fortunate event should give a chance for
escape. But I could see nothing to give hope now,
and despondency came over me as I thought of
what had been. Could it be that only a day had
passed since I had been with my company of the
<i>Trinity</i> alive and well upon the sand-spit? It
seemed a hundred years.</p>

<p>One by one the events of the last few days passed in
view and I found myself marveling not a little at the
actions of Diego de Baçan. He wished to torture me,
no doubt; but as I thought of his manner, it seemed
that he held me in a certain awe. The way in which his
life and mine seemed intertwined, the one with the
other, was strange indeed. I could not believe that
I was to die as he had intended—before Mademoiselle.
In spite of his boasts, I believed that she was
not there at the Camp of San Augustin, nor yet at
Fort Caroline,—now blood-christened San Mateo.
I recalled the vision when half-distracted I lay upon
the sands after the wreck, and I remembered the
look in the eyes of Mademoiselle as she balanced the
poniard upon her fingers. I had heard some of the
guards speak of certain women who had been saved
from Fort Caroline, but they were servants and
wives of artisans, and I had not the courage to ask
further. Had I done so they would doubtless have
insulted her and demeaned me, or perhaps brutally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
have told me of her death. So I thought it wise to
hold my peace, though my heart seemed bursting
within me. I watched the light flicker upon the
breastpiece of the guard beside the fire, and wondered
what the morrow would bring forth. Then
the anguish and struggle of the day told, and I fell
into deep and merciful sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning they took us out manacled two
and two and marched us up and down the square to
keep the blood in circulation, that the withes might
not bite too deep into the flesh before the time appointed;
and this they did thereafter daily. They
were fattening us like fowls. The soldiers came out
and jostled and spurned us, tossing billets of wood
at our heads so that we were dodging about, most of
the time in a quandary.</p>

<p>The guards seemed to have no interest in the
matter and watched composedly as the others danced
about us, laughing merrily at any sally more witty
than ordinary. But for my part, I found it better
to my liking than to lie there in the dark shadows
of the Lodge of Seloy trussed like pigs for the Tavistock
market. I bore these taunts and gibes in
rare good humor, for I was stretching my limbs and
could feel my strength coming back to me unimpaired.
On the second day they took away the
other prisoners, leaving only De Brésac and me together.
Why they had spared him he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
say, save only that Menendez himself, aiming a blow
at him with a poniard and blood-befuddled missing
his mark, had seen in that a sign of God’s displeasure,
and so saved him until he might debate
upon the subject.</p>

<p>On the third day De Baçan, in company of Menendez
de Avilés, going the rounds of the barracks, came
to where we lay. Menendez had on a costly suit of
black velvet with a cap to match, silk trunks and
boots of a fine leather. He began prodding at me
with his cane. “So this is the English heretic of
Dieppe,” he said, making an uncouth sound which
might have been a laugh in any other.</p>

<p>“Señor,” said De Baçan, “this man has as many
lives as a cat.”</p>

<p>“Ah! But no more! We must take him severally—one
life after the other. Have you thought of
the matter, Captain?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, your Excellency, save that the end for
this one must be certain.”</p>

<p>“And the other? Can they not be made to confess
in the Faith? ’Twould be a merciful work to
set them aright.”</p>

<p>As they turned away, Menendez laughingly
said,</p>

<p>“Have them well fattened, my good Captain, for
I like not scrawny captives. But after all we owe
this fellow much, and dog that he is——” but I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
not hear the rest of what he said. ’Twas no cheerful
conversation for De Brésac and me.</p>

<p>At the end of this day a thing most curious happened.
We were sitting bound by the fire, for after
the dropping of the sun the night grew raw and chill.
The guard had just been changed. The flames burned
brightly within and made a yellow ghost of the sentinel
at the door as he stood against the blackness
without. A second guard sat within the lodge, and
another could be seen down the path as he walked
slowly to and fro. The face of the man at the door
was held in the shadow of his morion, but I could
see that he wore a great black beard which covered
his face and that he was most stocky and strong of
build, the muscles of his calves and thighs swelling
out, much to my admiration, and his knotty fingers
betokening great strength. ’Twould be no easy task
to get by this fellow.</p>

<p>Suddenly, clear and distinct upon my ear, but not
so loud as to seem out of ordinary, came that same
low whistle I had heard once before in the prison
at Dieppe—the call of the boatswain upon the
<i>Griffin</i>! My heart stopped its beat,—I thought
that I had been dreaming, it was so low and
soft. Then it came again, and De Brésac would
have spoken of it had I not laid my hand against
his arm.</p>

<p>Whence did it come? I knew that I was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
mistaken now, and my heart was beating high. Then
the fellow at the door whom I had been watching,
after looking at his fellow guards, raised his head and
I saw the movement of his lips through the great
black mustache. I heard the whistle for the third
time. I looked around hastily at the guard in the
lodge, but he was intent upon burnishing his breastpiece.
Presently I said in English as though speaking
with De Brésac:</p>

<p>“Welcome, Job Goddard, to San Augustin,” and
I saw the shoulders of my sentinel shake in comprehension.
Then he shouldered his arquebus and
settled his sword in its sheath, walking up and down
again. He made a threatening and ugly figure
against the darkness, scowling as he walked, but he
was so welcome a sight I could have shouted in glee.
How in God’s providence had this seaman of mine
been spared?</p>

<p>Making no sign of aught unusual I talked on with
De Brésac, telling him who this man was and how,
God willing, we might make a break for liberty. I
bethought me of a plan to have a sign with Goddard.
I poured the water from the pitcher in a corner behind
the skins and then raising my voice I cried in
Spanish,</p>

<p>“Hey, señor the guard! Is it not possible to
have some water fresh from the spring? We die soon
enough, in all conscience.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>But Goddard made no sign, only walking up and
down and looking out into the night.</p>

<p>I was perplexed. What could be the matter with
the man? Could he not see the advantage I had
prepared?</p>

<p>“Hola, there!” I cried again, pointing to the
pitcher, “our throats are parched. Water! water!”
But he made no motion of having understood.</p>

<p>Then the other fellow came forward grumbling.</p>

<p>“You Frenchmen have throats of flint,” he
growled, “but you may shout at that fellow till you
die of weariness and he will not hear, for he has lost
both speech and hearing. Patiño must think you
safe enough. A fine fashion, I say, to leave the eyes
and ears for me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, he hears not?” said I, comprehending.</p>

<p>“He is of a detachment from Fort San Mateo
that came down to-night. I do not know him.”</p>

<p>And taking the pitcher he went out past Goddard,
jostling him with an oath, and so toward the spring
that was at the corner of the building. No sooner
had he gone than Goddard—being sure the third
guard could not see—sprang with a bound to where
we were lying.</p>

<p>“You must get away to-night, Master Sydney,”
he whispered hoarsely. “To-morrow they’ll find
me out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said I, starting up in excitement, “cut
me loose!”</p>

<p>“No!—not now! The square is full of soldiers.
To-night! The scuts are drinking brandy brought
from the Fort, sir. Before the change of the watch,
I’ll have weapons an’ help ye both. Sh——” and
he moved back to his post, for the third sentinel had
come to the path.</p>

<p>In a moment the surly fellow who had gone for
water returned, and set the pitcher down between
us. He found us talking with unconcern; though
I felt my temples throbbing so that I feared he
would discover me, and I was glad enough to raise
the pitcher to my lips to conceal my excitement.
De Brésac kept countenance well; and, unsuspecting,
the guard returned to the task of cleaning the spots
from his plates and morion.</p>

<p>We could now hear plainly the shouts of the soldiers
as they sang and danced in the square, though
for an angle in the doorway we could not see them.
They were making a fine festival over their feats of
butchery!</p>

<p>“’Tis fortunate,” whispered De Brésac, “for we
may yet make a good running fight for it.”</p>

<p>“Aye, Chevalier. ’Tis better to be spitted outright
than to die at intervals. I think we may give
some account of ourselves.”</p>

<p>“If I had but a piece of steel,” he groaned,—“but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
a piece of steel—I would make carrion of the fellow
with the morion there!”</p>

<p>“Aye, and you haven’t! Wait a little. Something
may happen.”</p>

<p>But like most plans of the like, this one came to
naught; and I saw our hopes of escape upon that
night go glimmering. For at about three hours
from sunset who should come into the hut but Don
Diego de Baçan with a quarrelsome disposition of
mind and a swaggering body. He had been drinking
freely and still carried a jug of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie</i>, from which
he drank at intervals while he talked. With him
were two officers, by name Vincente and Patiño.
Patiño, a thin black fidgety shadow of a man, was
captain of the watch. He had been upon the <i>San
Cristobal</i> and I remembered him well. Fortunately,
he, too, had drunk more than was good, for otherwise
he was just such a squirming worm to pry into
all small affairs with most profit, and I trembled lest
Job Goddard should betray himself. They had us carried
into the main hall, where a fire of logs was built;
and then when chairs and table had been brought,
they set upon us in every conceivable fashion to try
the temper; to the end that in a short while De
Brésac, whose nerves were near the surface, was
touched to the very quick of his honor and lay foaming,
speechless with rage.</p>

<p>It suited the humor of De Baçan to offer us drink;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of which, since it came from his own jug, I took a
little, though it was not needful for the business
I had in hand, and I never had a habit of much
drinking.</p>

<p>“Well, my petticoat hunter,” he jeered at last,
“you have made a fine mess of this business, sure
enough.”</p>

<p>“I must confess, Señor,” I replied, smiling up at
him, “that I am none so comfortable as I might be.”</p>

<p>“Comfort is ever the desire of old women and
Englishmen, Sir Pirato!”</p>

<p>“But we have no chance to exercise—to stretch
our limbs——” I began.</p>

<p>“Stretch indeed!” put in little Patiño. “There
is a rack in the camp; it can stretch you out to ten
feet at least, my friend.”</p>

<p>“’Tis only a matter of a few inches more or less,”
said De Baçan, laughing, “and upon my life, I have
ever thought you too broad across the shoulders to
be in good proportion.” Then the three of them
roared with laughing.</p>

<p>I saw no humor in this speech.</p>

<p>“In a bout at strength I find the breadth of shoulder
of some small value,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well said! The old woman grows a spicy
tongue, Patiño. Humph! You like the shoulders
broad,—mayhap you’d like them broader; we can
stretch or draw you out in any direction to suit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
fancy—cut you down or push you in—eh! Patiño?—bloat
you up or pull you out—as you will. What
think you of the business?”</p>

<p>“There is small profit in it for me, Señor,” I
replied in good part.</p>

<p>“He’s content with his deformity, Vincente.”</p>

<p>“’Tis like a smug Englishman,” sneered Patiño.</p>

<p>“Nay, I am but a slow sort of person, lieutenant,
and find your mode of progress far too rapid,” I
laughed.</p>

<p>“Bah!” growled Diego. “You fancy yourself
most satisfactory upon all points.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing that these Englishmen can do,”
lisped Patiño, “but eat and sleep—eat and sleep——”</p>

<p>“And fight, Señor,” said I. “You have forgotten
the <i>Great Griffin</i>.”</p>

<p>And as De Baçan laughed at him, the little man
hid his face in his mug in chagrin.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it, Englishman?” said Diego,
smiling. “Let me tell you that the most of life lies
not in fighting. There is one thing,”—and he
paused significantly,—“one thing you fat-headed
English don’t know—nor ever will. And do you
care what that is? It’s woman! No more notion
of the art of loving have you than a row of marlinespikes,
no more warmth of temper than a dolphinfish!
Pouf! You live too far away from the sun to
have much success with ladies, Señor Killigrew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>I foresaw now that finding other means unavailing
to try my temper, he meant again to speak of Mademoiselle,
knowing that here he had a never-failing
source of rancor. I glanced to where Job Goddard
stood at the doorway and a look passed between us.
Then he went out into the shadow and disappeared
down the path.</p>

<p>I knew not whither Goddard had gone, and wishing
to gain time, said with as good grace as I could
summon,</p>

<p>“The Spanish have ever had the repute for great
courtliness of manner, Don de Baçan.”</p>

<p>“You speak in ignorance, my fledgling. It is no
question of manner, but of a thousand things you
beef-eaters have no notion of.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Patiño, ruefully, twisting his mustache,
“and their women are as bad as themselves.”</p>

<p>“Bah! they’re cold and lifeless every one of them.
It is the French women who respond most aptly and
most—er—delightfully—eh, Vincente?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my captain,” he replied. “And of those
saved from Fort Caroline”—and he grinned like a
ghoul—“there are five or six most enticing.”</p>

<p>“And most responsive you would say—eh? You
are successful upon most occasions, Vincente.” And
so saying he poured out a pot half full of his fiery
liquor, which he straightway drained to the dregs,
setting the vessel down with a crash which split it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
half in two. Then he called to Goddard for a new
pot and more liquor. But Goddard would not hear,
and the other man was sent.</p>

<p>“No, ’tis not courtliness, Señor Pirato,” said he,
leaning forward at last, “but a matter which concerns
only the lover and the lady—the flash of an
eye—the touch of a hand—which sends the pulses
tingling; the opening of the lips—which tremble for
the touch of kisses—this and much more.”</p>

<p>At this moment there was a noise without, which
sounded like a groan, followed by silence, and I
knew why Job Goddard had gone out by the sentry’s
path.</p>

<p>“What was it?” said Vincente, staggering to the
door. But Job Goddard met him there most unconcerned,
pointing out over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“’Tis nothing but some drunken beast of a soldier,”
said Patiño. And Vincente came back to the
table.</p>

<p>I now knew there was no time to lose, and made
up my mind upon a course of action. Catching the
eye of De Brésac, I suddenly began to strain at my
bonds, jumping and struggling as well as I could
about the fire, rolling at last under the table.</p>

<p>“Here! here! what is the man about?” shouted
Patiño. “Help, sentry, help, he will get away!”</p>

<p>Goddard came running in and fell upon me with
all his weight as though trying to secure me. I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
his keen knife slit through the bonds and a poniard
was thrust into my hand. Then we rolled out from
under the table as though struggling furiously, and
so upon De Brésac, Goddard turning him loose and
arming him as he had armed me.</p>

<p>The drunken fools seemed in a kind of stupor, not
alive to what was really happening until we three
sprang upon our feet. The surprise was complete
and the advantage was clearly with us. I have
never struck a blow so hard as that one which I put
upon the face of this Vincente, for he went flying
backward over the table, upon his head, his boots
sticking up over a bench. Before Patiño could even
draw, Goddard thrust him through the heart and he
sank down, making no sound.</p>

<p>De Brésac, seizing a sword, valiantly had set upon
De Baçan; who, giving a roar like a bull, fell to with
such energy that the Frenchman was put immediately
upon the defensive and was forced over toward
the door, through which, before we knew it, De
Baçan vanished like the wind, running out across the
square to the barracks of the men, yelling like a demon
the while. He was a fiend incarnate, this man.</p>

<p>There was not a moment to lose. Seizing the
weapons of Patiño and Vincente, we dashed out
around the corner of the lodge and so into the forest,
running at the top of our speed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a><br />
<small>OF OUR ESCAPE.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">As we sped up the wide path through the thicket,
we could hear De Baçan as he ran bellowing
across the square. It was black darkness under
the branches, but as we accustomed ourselves we
could make out the line of the path ahead. Twigs
and branches struck us in the face, but Goddard thundered
on with great confidence, setting for us a good
round pace, and De Brésac, who was a fleet runner,
keeping close upon his heels.</p>

<p>In a moment there were loud cries from the buildings
behind, but we could hear plain above them all
the great roars of Don Diego as the soldiers came
after us in full pursuit. Ignorant of the road as
we were we had the advantage of being in our
sober senses, spurred, moreover, by the love of life,
which now at this chance came with a fulness to
nerve us for any desperateness. After all the suffering
of mind and body which had gone before, this
freedom was sweet indeed, and in our hearts we
knew that we could not again fall alive into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
hands of these people. The fresh air of the forest
tasted sweet to the throat, and I drank it greedily
into my lungs as I ran, following the gray shadows
ahead of me.</p>

<p>After a while, we heard the shouting of De Baçan
no more, only the cries of some of the soldiers who
were speedily coming forward.</p>

<p>But the great speed told upon us, and the sea
legs of Job Goddard, which were not meant for such
work as this, refused to move so rapidly and he fell
a little behind. De Brésac seemed imbued with new
life and ran with great agility, leaping over logs and
twisting through the bushes like one brought up to
the crafts of the woods rather than the courtesies
and fantasies of the Court.</p>

<p>But it was uncertain and awkward progress at
best. Goddard had a pike and an arquebus, while
De Brésac and I had each a poniard and a rapier.
Twice I fell prone to the ground over the tree
trunks and bushes, and once had overrun Goddard
in the dark and we two had fallen, rolling over in a
monstrous tangle. The sound of the pursuit was
growing louder every minute; De Brésac paused,
impatient at our awkwardness. He could have got
well away had he wished, but he only stood there
as we stumbled to our feet, the sound of men crashing
through the bushes showing how near were the
more fleet-footed of these Spaniards. It was desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
work for heavy men. Off we started once
more, De Brésac seizing the arquebus to lighten the
burden of Goddard, who was swearing and trying to
rub his shin, which he had bruised most severely,
with his pike-handle.</p>

<p>We came to an open space two hundred yards or
so in width in which the Indians had planted a field
of maize. But the crop had been garnered and only
the short stalks remained. The moon had come out
and it seemed hardly possible that we could get
across this open and escape discovery. Could we
but reach the other side where the deeper forest
began there would seem to be less chance of immediate
capture. Goddard was well-nigh done, but
managed to struggle on over the rough loam toward
an opening in the bush beyond. De Brésac had
passed him and entered the wood, and I had come
to his side, when behind us there was a loud shouting
and two soldiers, stripped of their armor,
emerged from the forest and came toward us at the
top of their speed.</p>

<p>De Brésac stopped and dropped down upon one
knee, and I knew what he meant to do. Goddard
fell almost exhausted beside him and I crouched
behind a bush a little to the rear, awaiting the coming
of our adversaries. We were all breathing very
hard, but De Brésac, full of vitality, was crouched
like a cat ready to spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“The one in front,” said he to me in a whisper,
“I will account for the other.”</p>

<p>On the Spaniards came, leaping from one hillock
to another, their naked weapons gleaming fitfully in
the moonlight. The fellow in advance was but a
boy; his hair was fair and he was comely to see.
My heart misgave me as he came nearer, rushing
onward fearlessly. But it was his life or mine,—my
life and Mademoiselle’s, perhaps—and so I did not
hesitate, rising just as he came into the shadow of
the trees and running him through with such force
that the basket hilt of the weapon struck against
him and as he fell the blade broke short off against
the ground. The other man, seeing the fate of his
comrade, paused for a moment; but De Brésac was
upon him like a flash and sent his sword a-flying.
After all, these lives in the heat of action were few
enough against those of all our friends who had been
murdered in cold blood before.</p>

<p>Then De Brésac, who was a man of ingenuity, drew
the bodies under some bushes and we started off
along in the shadow of the woods at the edge of the
clearing toward the left—doubling in a way upon
our own track to throw our pursuers the more surely
off in another direction.</p>

<p>We saw two, and then six more, of them go flying
across the clearing, following the track of our boots
in the soft earth; but they did not pause, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
crashing through and shouting to one another until
the sounds were lost in the many voices of the
night. We were free—at least for the present.</p>

<p>We looked around the one to the other, and long
breaths burst at the same moment from the three
of us.</p>

<p>“Phew! Master Sydney,” said Goddard, pulling
his beard, which had been glued to his cheeks, “’tis
little I thought I’d ever get up in this <em>dis</em>-guise, sir.
Odds bobs, but I’m done! I’ve been feedin’ up this
night, to last a week, sir,—an’ me stommick—is
somethin’ feeble—since—this—smoke—suckin’.”
He fell to the ground, breathing like a bellows, and
vowed he would move no more.</p>

<p>Then De Brésac planned quickly. “If we go
to the beach,” he said, “they will surely take us.
There they can drive us into the sea, or prison us on
one of these sand-spits, and take us at their ease. Let
us keep among the woods and the swamps. There
we can retreat at will, and may support life until we
can find a friend, or come to the great inland channel
of which they speak. We may come upon the
canoes of the Indians of Satouriona, for the Potanous
are far to the west, and the Thimagoas of Outina
are to the south.”</p>

<p>We saw that what he said was wise, for Menendez,
now thinking the beach his natural shambles,
would certainly try again to find us there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>At any rate, where we were was no comfortable
neighborhood, for some stray Spaniard might at any
moment be stumbling upon us, and then there
would surely be more killing, and I was sick at the
sight of blood, and wanted no more of it. So in
some fashion, when he had got his breath, we put
Goddard on his feet and moved steadily forward,
pausing only now and then to listen for the signs of
pursuit. In this way we moved for two hours
through the moss-hanging forest. We talked but
little, having need of all our strength and breath.</p>

<p>Goddard managed to tell his story. He had been
struck upon the head and had fallen for dead under
a pile of corpses. When he had come to himself it
was dark, and the Spaniards had gone. He had come
across the bay at night in a canoe he found at the
landing-place. He possessed himself of the arms
and weapons of a Spaniard who was sleeping in the
woods,—and who sleeps there yet; cutting off the
soldier’s beard and fastening the hair of it upon
himself with tree-gum. Then making a detour, he
had come in at nightfall, following in the footsteps
of a detachment of the soldiery who had marched
down from Fort San Mateo, and in the confusion and
debauchery of the camp, by simulating dumbness,
escaped detection, taking the sentry duty with little
difficulty. It was a most wonderful thing; but
Goddard would say little further than this, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
smiling when he spoke of the Spaniard in the woods.
He took off his morion and mopped the sweat from
his brow.</p>

<p>“Master Sydney, I saw Jem Smith die, sir,” he said.
“He went to join his martyrs with a smile on his
lips. He wore his velvet suit o’ black, an’ he was
beautiful to see. I saw him die, sir,—cut down like
a dog afore my eyes. An’, sir, I saw the man as did
it.” He tapped the Spanish morion with a significant
gesture, and then grimly,—“’Twas him!”</p>

<p>We had covered a distance of perhaps three
leagues when we came to a body of water, which
seemed a kind of river, but not so wide as the River
of May; only a hundred yards across to the thither
bank. There we stopped to plan, for Goddard
could not swim. It looked but a short time before
the day, for the heavens were brightening through
the great trees behind us. If we could place Job
Goddard upon the trunk of a tree, then we might
push him across the stream; there was one floating
out in the current. De Brésac had removed his boots
to swim for it, and had even taken a step down into
the slime of the bank, when, as we looked, the log
began sluggishly to move, but against the current,
and then we saw the thing was alive. De Brésac
rushed out upon high ground in terror, for the log
was no log at all, but one of those great horny
lizards, which Admiral Hawkins has since reported,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and which are called <i>crocodiles</i>, or <i>alligartos</i>. If the
Spaniards had come upon us at that moment, they
could have taken us without a fight, for this beast
was of such a great size and length, so ugly moreover
and slimy, that we stood with knees trembling
upon the bank. But by and by Job Goddard,
plucking his courage up, cast a stone at it, and as
the missile fell in the water the great beast, with a
flurry and a splash of its tail, went plowing down
the stream more frightened even than we.</p>

<p>The heavens were well alight before we could
persuade ourselves to make the attempt to cross.
Sure at last that there was no fording place, we
three got astride of a wide log and began the passage
of this treacherous stream, expecting each moment
to have a leg nipped off at the knee. We had long
pieces of bark for paddles, and made a great commotion,
thinking thus to scare these monstrous animals
away; and finally we arrived upon the other
bank, wet, and trembling with fright, but safe.</p>

<p>Upon the third day the Chevalier shot at a furry
wild animal which lay in a ball at the top of a tree.
He had the skill to carry away the twig on which it
swung. The beast fell to the ground snarling like a
dog, to be killed in a trice by Goddard, who pinned
it to the earth with his pike. We were most hungry
and fell to upon this beast like wolves, hardly waiting
for the flesh to be cooked through. ’Twas little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
enough, but kept us alive two days. On the morning
of the fifth day we saw the great inland channel,
which we afterwards discovered was a part of the
River of May, and by good fortune came upon a
hunting party of Satouriona’s warriors. I have said
that we came upon them, but it were more truthful
to say that they came upon us. For an arrow
whirred past and we looked around to see half a
score of them coming from the thicket. I held up
my hand, shouting loudly “<i>Antipola! Antipola bonnasson!</i>”—which
means “friend”—and they came
forward and welcomed us with great rejoicing. They
fed us on game which they had shot with arrows,
and took us at last in a canoe to their village. I had
seen the Paracousi—the “Chief,”—when we first
came to Fort Caroline. He was named Emola and
entertained us in his lodge, sparing nothing for our
comfort.</p>

<p>De Brésac was tireless. Liberty was breath to his
nostrils, and he went about in the village inquiring
and planning, making ready to continue our pilgrimage
to the coast when we should be rested.</p>

<p>For myself, with liberty came a reaction from
those horrible days and nights upon the ship, on the
sand-spit and in the prison, when in my deeper moods
of despair I could see no hope to bring Mademoiselle
out of this country alive. In spite of the continuous
dread at my heart, there had come again in all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
first eagerness the desire only to find her and take
her in my arms away from that dreadful Menendez,
the very nearness of whom befouled and polluted.
I was certain of but one thing—that she was not at
San Augustin. Had she been there, in those last
days De Baçan would have lost no opportunity to
bring us together for his own pleasure, that he might
gloat upon us the better and keep his promise of
torture to me. But where could she be? What had
happened that she was not a prisoner of De Baçan?
For it seemed certain that she had been saved from
Fort Caroline. I was in a great quandary, and for
all my uncertainty I had not the will even to question
the Indians upon the subject, for in spite of my
hopes I feared—feared the truth they might tell
me.</p>

<p>We sat about the lodge of this good Emola, looking
out at the bright forest, gaining back our strength
and will. Well do I remember that wonderful day
with its great stillness and sadness. The Paracousi
sat by the open doorway, dark against the golden
sunshine, smoking from a great tobacco bowl which
he offered to us one after the other. We each took
a swallow of it, this being the habit of these people
when in good will, and Goddard, bringing forth his
own bowl and reed, helped himself from the pouch
of Emola and was soon puffing away valiantly to the
great satisfaction of the Chief. It was most curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to see these two sucking upon the reeds like babes
upon the breast, and puffing out the smoke in curls
and rings, regarding each other the while with great
solemnity.</p>

<p>“Ye see, Master Sydney,” said Goddard between
puffs, “if once I can get me stommick made good
against the smoke suckin’, ’twill be a most gratifyin’
achievin’. For though we may find an’ win no new
lands—by the beards of the martyrs, ’tis surely somethin’
we have done to make the discovery of a new
habitude, or taste, which has much of the vartue an’
little of the inconvenciency of drinkin’.”</p>

<p>I could not but smile at this sally, for things most
ridiculous have a way of intruding themselves upon
the most sad and melancholy moments of life.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we will push onward to the sea,—is
it not so?” asked De Brésac abruptly.</p>

<p>This brought me to myself.</p>

<p>“I am most uncertain, monsieur,” I replied. “I
hardly know in which way my duty or desire lies.
I have felt to this moment as though my greatest
wish were to find my way back to Europe and set
the armies of all civilized nations about the ears of
this devil Menendez de Avilés. But now that I am
free—well, monsieur—I will tell you.”</p>

<p>Whereupon I told him briefly of the love I bore
for Diane de la Notte, of the hope I had of her escape
from death and of my fears for her safety, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
at the last that I could not leave the vicinity of
San Augustin until I was sure that she was not in
the power of Diego de Baçan.</p>

<p>As I told my story his face saddened. “I suspected
as much,” he said. “There is a great bond
between us, monsieur; I too have loved—the sister
of La Caille was my betrothed. When she died, I
vowed I would look no more upon the face of
woman, and so I came here to this savage land to
lose my sorrow in adventure and perhaps in death.
And I have come only to lose him I loved best
after his sister.” He spoke of La Caille. “No,
monsieur, I cannot forget—and it is fated that I
shall not die. That is my story.”</p>

<p>I wrung him silently by the hand.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, monsieur,” he went on quickly, “there
is a duty which you and I owe to our God—a duty
stronger than any earthly tie. A foul deed has been
done which has no equal in the history of the world.”
He paused a moment. “Forgive me if I seem to
bring more grief to your heart. But I know that
there is no chance upon this earth to see again the
one you love. Believe me, what I say is true.
It is the love that is in your heart which makes you
wilful not to ask and to believe the thing you most
dread.”</p>

<p>I buried my face in my hands, for it was so and I
was a coward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Monsieur, listen,” he continued softly. “Do not
blind yourself further to these facts. For you will
but add one more life to those which have already
been recklessly thrown away. And with your doubts
at rest, your life should be given to Justice.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but my heart can never again be satisfied
until I have found her!”</p>

<p>“Then I must tell you the truth, mon ami, whatever
may come. I have spoken with these Indians
in such manner as it was possible, and I know most
of the things that have happened since the massacre.
I have seen articles which came from the Fort, and
I know that there are no women there at this time.
Many of them were cut down and killed. A few
only were taken towards San Augustin; with them
was Mademoiselle de la Notte.”</p>

<p>I started up. “Diane—and how——”</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur! calm yourself and listen with a
stout heart—for I have dreadful news. She was of
a party of women. There were Spanish soldiers
with them. When these women got to a certain
place they would go no further. The soldiers then
killed them as they had done the others.”</p>

<p>“But this is mere hazard—how do you know?
What proofs have you?” I cried in anguish.</p>

<p>“Only this,” he said solemnly; “I have myself
beheld it and you will know.” And going to Emola
he made a motion towards his hand. The Paracousi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
produced from his belt a bit of gold and De Brésac
placed it in my hands. It was the finger ring with
the ancient setting which Diane had worn!</p>

<p>I took the bauble from him silently, stupidly,
and then unconsciously bore it to my lips. Slowly
the cruel truth dawned upon me as I looked at the
jewel. It seemed as though my breast were bursting
with the emotions that flooded up from that secret
corner in my soul in which man hides the things he
holds most holy. What would I not have given for
woman’s tears to have wept out upon it all the tenderness
in my heart? I could only bend over it
reverently, dry-eyed, mutely suffering. But I had
undergone all this torture before, and the certainty
now that she had died seemed to make no further
enduring wound. I sat at last, looking at Emola as
he told how the ring had come to him from one of
his braves, who had exchanged it for some silver
neck-pieces. After the first shock of this dreadful
discovery, I seemed rather stupefied than aught else,
with no capacity for great grief nor any great sensation
of any kind.</p>

<p>When he understood, the Paracousi came and put
his hand upon my shoulder, and this aroused me.
He indicated by pointing that he would give me the
ring which I still held in my hand. I thanked him
with a look and a hand-clasp and got upon my feet,
stretching my limbs, arising from my grief-stupor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had finished speaking I turned to the
Chevalier De Brésac, saying to him:</p>

<p>“My friend, I will follow wherever you will lead.”</p>

<p>He took me by one hand joyfully, and Job
Goddard with gruff heartiness seized the other.
Then we three, of no religion, but made one by suffering
and the loss of those three persons we loved
the best, took an oath, with the grave Paracousi for
witness, that not while we lived would we rest until
we had seen our enemies visited with vengeance by
fire and the sword.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a><br />
<small>IN WHICH WE JOURNEY TO PARIS.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">If I have dwelt upon these events hitherto with
great particularity, it is that there might be a
record of all that passed and that the devotion of
this seaman Goddard, a yeoman of England, should
be known to all men. Of the Chevalier de Brésac,
I need say nothing further at this time, since his
public service is well known alike in England and
France.</p>

<p>Upon the morning following my discovery of the
ring with the ancient setting, we entered one of the
great war canoes in company with the Paracousi
Emola and eight warriors, and set forth upon our
journey to the sea. There was nothing to fear from
the Spaniards, for the camp of Emola was in the
country of Satouriona, and until we came again
within sight of the battlements of Fort San Mateo,
there was little danger of discovery; and even had
we been attacked we should have been able to give
a good account of ourselves. The River of May for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
a long distance was shallow, but of a great width and
seemed like a vast morass. At noon on the following
day we set into a current which speedily took
us into a deeper channel, where the sand grasses no
longer waved beside us. The paddles dipped deep
and, as they sent the water gurgling musically
astern, put us along down-stream at a fair brave
rate.</p>

<p>By and by the Indians told us that Fort San
Mateo was but four leagues below; and, as it lacked
an hour to sunset, we hauled in our canoe to the
bank to await the friendly cover of night before
resuming our journey to the sea. But there was
little need for precaution, for we saw no sign of
human life. We stole along the shadow of the
western shore, drifting down with the tide, which was
ebbing strongly. At some time after midnight the
sound of men’s voices singing a rough chorus came
up to us on the wind; and in a while we crept out
from behind a point of land to see the lights of Fort
San Mateo, lurid and garish, come dancing down to
us across the face of the star-sprinkled waters. The
Spaniards were making merry, and the hoarse sound
of their laughter blasphemed the sweetness of the
night, and shivered the silence again and again with
its echoes. They had no fear of attack. Had they not
swept out of existence a whole nation from these new
shores? We saw no sentries upon the bastions even,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and passed fairly under the cannon, arousing no
challenge or inquiry. When we had passed below
the Fort, a desperate sadness fell upon me again at
the sight of the familiar shore and hills at which
she and I had looked together. I turned my head
and looked back as I had on that morning when
we went down to the sea to give battle to the
Spaniards. I seemed to see her standing there again
upon the battlements tall and lithe, looking fearlessly
up at me as I told her my fears. The farewell,
the tender tears in her eyes, the touch of her fingers,
all—all were as real as though it had been but yesterday
instead of two long months ago,—months of
suffering which had made days into weeks and weeks
into years. The pain came again fiercely to my
breast and I caught my breath to ease it. The firm
fingers of De Brésac closed upon my own as he
whispered.</p>

<p>“Courage, mon brave! Courage!”</p>

<p>Ah me! The meaning of the travails through
which we are brought to our better understanding
are little known of men—nor will be through many
generations of time. In a moment or so the pang
was past, and in a sudden flash of unreason—Nature’s
compensation for her sorrows—I felt again as I had
felt before, that Mademoiselle was at that moment
somewhere near—not cold in death—but breathing
and living. All this in spite of the ring, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
silent evidence of the truth of what had been
spoken, which I felt at every breath, against my
heart.</p>

<p>We had passed a little below the Fort and had
drifted toward a bluff of dunes which jutted out into
the stream almost athwart our course—for here the
channel runs close to the shore. Upon this point
grew a thatch of palmetto scrub and knot of stunted
firs and pines, whose gnarled branches stretched
this way and that, an impenetrable black tangle
against the starlit sky. As we came nearer, the dark
blur of the branches took a definite form, and we
could mark their gentle sway in the breeze. We
were bearing toward a sand bar which jutted well out
toward the other shore and I would have spoken of it;
but as I turned, Emola seized me by the arm, placing
his hand upon his mouth in token of silence. He
and the warriors were craning their heads toward the
out-spreading branches. They sat mute as statues,
saying no word. I could not make it out. Long as
I stared I saw no sign or heard no movement save
the rhythm of the swaying branches.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by one of the Indians beside
me who uttered a hoarse sound in his throat, and
lifting his head he passed his index finger grimly
around his neck. We drifted in again with the current,
and in a moment we understood. There, a horrid
plaything for the wind of the sea, its clothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
limp and loose, we saw a human body, swinging by
the neck!</p>

<p>De Brésac started up. “Par la Mort!” he cried.
“The infamous ones! Honest braves, fighting for
their King, to be given this dog’s death! Come,
Emola, land us here. It is too much, mon ami! He
shall not hang so!” He was almost sobbing with the
stress of his emotion.</p>

<p>The paddles swept us in to the beach and we
climbed the dunes to where the body was hung.
Over its head that villain had nailed a piece of white
bark upon which had been burned the dreadful confession,</p>

<p class="noic">“<i>Not As To Frenchmen<br />
  But As To Lutherans!</i>”</p>

<p>Tenderly, as though he had been one of those we
three most deeply mourned, we cut him down and
tried to straighten his poor stiffened limbs. Then
we carried him where the sand was soft and with the
canoe paddles buried him out of sight. There were
others, we knew, for the placard had said it, and
three more we saw hung in the same way and bearing
the same inscription. These we cut down and
buried as we had buried the first, while Emola and
his warriors stood by and gravely watched. Then
silently as though the hand of death were upon our
own hearts, we entered the canoe again and pushed
onward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>The tide had turned; but before dawn we had
come well within the sound of the surf and pulled
into a secluded river or creek on the north bank, before
the sun had come out of the sea. We ate a
portion of dried venison apiece, and concealing the
canoe among the branches, cut into the thicket,
Goddard carrying a large packet of tobacco which
the Paracousi had given him. By marching steadily
all the morning along the line of this river, we came
by noon to another body of water as large as the
River of May. Here we halted again, and to our
surprise and great joy discovered a small vessel
riding securely at anchor, and flying the flag of
France!</p>

<p>There is no need to dwell at length upon the
events which followed. The vessel was the <i>Epervier</i>,
Captain Gillonne, of the fleet of poor Ribault.
After much signaling a boat was lowered from her
side and many men armed with arquebus and pike
dropped down into her. They approached within
thirty yards of the shore, when we proved to them
by word of mouth that we were no Spaniards but
men of their own company. Then they brought their
boat in upon the beach and welcomed us with great
rejoicing. The <i>Epervier</i> had been upon the sea for
many weeks, and blown to the southward, had ridden
through the fury of the storm which had sent
the other vessels upon the coast. The Frenchmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
had seen the wrecks upon the beach, but no man save
a few soldiers in armor carrying a standard of Spain.
They had come to the River of May only to find
our Fort in the hands of the enemy and had much to
do to escape to the open sea again, out of range of
the Spanish ordnance. This gallant Gillonne, watchful
against the Spaniards, remained warily at anchor,
hoping by this delay to save any Frenchman who
might have escaped, although he thus placed himself
in direst jeopardy of capture by the Spanish fleet.</p>

<p>It seemed, then, that most of our physical sufferings
were to end. We went aboard the “great canoe”
as the Paracousi called it, Captain Gillonne setting
red wine before these Indians, which indeed they
drank with as much avidity as Job Goddard himself.
They walked about the vessel looking up at
the rigging, speaking among themselves, though they
made no outward sign of curiosity, surprise or any
other emotion. They are a strange people, these
Caribs; haughty, and solitary as the great pines which
tower in their wild forests. The good Paracousi was
given many gifts to carry back to his people. He
bore messages of good will from the French to the
great Satouriona, and we three who had been his
guests shook him by the hand and smoked a pipe of
peace, which Goddard brought forth from beneath
his doublet. The chief and his warriors departed
to the shore as gravely and silently as they had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The people of the <i>Epervier</i> all sickened for the
sight of France; and the provisions being low, it
was at last decided to set sail. There was small
chance of finding other refugees and the danger of
capture was imminent, depending only upon discovery.
And so we hoisted our anchor in the morning
and with a brisk wind sailed forth from that harbor
into the open sea, seeing no Spanish ships and making
a clear run to the eastward out of land-sight by
evening. Of the trials of that voyage I will not
speak, since the matter is one having no importance
in the description of these events. It is
enough that after many weeks of storm and stress,
privation and suffering, we had a fight with a Spanish
vessel, but being weak-handed were glad enough
to get secure away. A sickness broke out among our
men, but we landed at last, worn by adversity, at
Rochelle in France.</p>

<p>As before written, I make no attempt to
justify my actions in the happenings which followed.
Thrust by ill-fortune out of employment, I had
made this quarrel my own. And the love which had
changed me for the nonce from man to god had now
turned me devil. A new glory had shone into my
life for a short hour and made me all resplendent
with its gold—but the light had gone out and the
darkness hung like a pall about my soul. I could
not reason but with relation to the dark thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
which filled my mind. I thirsted for vengeance upon
Menendez and Diego de Baçan, and there was no
slaking. Nor could I understand that I, a quiet-tempered
English lad, had turned adventurer like a
Moor or a Spaniard. It was the tame stable-dog
made wolfish by the sight of blood. I have said
much of the cruelty of the Spaniards, but as I look
back upon those dreadful times and the more dreadful
ones which followed, I know that I was as mad
as the others and that we were no instruments of
God—as, to ease our consciences, we said we were,—but
only the willing tools of our own passions.</p>

<p>Truly the Chevalier de Brésac was animated by
much the same spirit as myself. For upon French
soil he proved himself a man of resource. The roads
were blocked with snow, but friends in Rochelle
made our journey to Paris possible; and in the
middle of the month of December we rode into that
city by the Porte St. Marcel. De Brésac was a fine
horseman and I had been bred to ride long before
I took to a sailor’s life, but it was no tranquil riding
for Job Goddard. The beasts were of the quietest,
but even so he found it no easy matter to keep upright
in the saddle, and was three times tossed into
the snow drifts, from which he emerged swearing and
vowing that he would ride no more.</p>

<p>“’Tis worse than the weather top-gallant yardarm
in a cross-chop, Master Sydney,” he would say, “an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
never a lift or handful o’ sail to hang on by. For
d’ye see, sir, this craft will mind no helm but the
fore sheets, and ’tis mighty poor sailin’ in a squall.”
He bore so rueful a countenance that we laughed at
him in spite of ourselves, and by dint of much persuading
and lifting he was got each time again in
the saddle.</p>

<p>Once within the gates of Paris we rode straightway
to the house of M. Henri de Teligny, the uncle
of my good friend. He was a fine, bristly, red-visaged,
gallant figure of a man; an old soldier, a
man of much power and, as we soon learned, with a
leaning to the cause of the Huguenots. He welcomed
the Chevalier with every mark of affection,
and after bidding us to the hospitality of his house,
caused refreshments to be brought and plied his
nephew with questions as to his adventures in New
France. It had been the intention of De Brésac to
approach him with some care and niceness upon matters
of religion and to bring out an expression upon
the tale before enlisting his sympathies in our cause.
Therefore, he at first was guarded in his replies,
using a very skilful diplomacy. But when he had
at last fairly begun, the old man listened to the
story of the massacres of Fort Caroline and San
Augustin with undisguised horror. He had heard
rumors from Spain that the French colony was destroyed.
He had not entirely believed it; but, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
it true, victory had been gained by honorable war
and not by criminal deceit. He could not remain
quiet through the telling of the real tale and strode
up and down the chamber pulling at his gray mustaches
and venting himself in the loudest expressions
of wrath and sorrow. When the Chevalier had come
to the voyage in the canoe and the discovery of the
swinging bodies over which the legends had been
placed, he could contain himself no longer.</p>

<p>“Jarnichien!” he shouted. “Hung like a pirate
or a Marane! Par la Pâque Dieu! It is a stain upon
the honor—not of Coligny—but of France! These
Spaniards think that this New World was made only
for themselves and that no other living man has a
right to move or breathe there!”</p>

<p>“Would even that justify the murder of French
women and children, my General?” returned the
Chevalier keenly.</p>

<p>“La Dogue! I should say, no! You were gentlemen
of France with a patent from your King to
settle in this Terre aux Bretons, which is as much
the property of France as of Spain.”</p>

<p>“Since this Colomb first set foot upon the land
the Spanish claim it all. Menendez has said it.”</p>

<p>“And that all others are Moors or piratos, to have
their throats slit like hogs or be hung like thieves?
Ah! perhaps even in Spain there is justice for such
Generals as Menendez de Avilés! This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
King’s quarrel, mes garçons, not yours. Forquevaulx
is our Ambassador to Madrid. I know him
well. We have fought side by side in siege and
field. He too is a soldier and knows what a soldier’s
death, as well as his life, should be. This is murder—assassination,
I tell you—of the foulest kind!
Done openly, and not even Philip of Spain could
countenance it. Forquevaulx shall demand the
degradation of this man.”</p>

<p>He paused, out of breath and countenance from
rapid speaking. Here truly was a friend indeed;
we had not counted upon such a valiant partisan.</p>

<p>“The Admiral shall know of these facts at once.
I will go to him—or better—he shall come to me.
The Hôtel de Châtillon and the Louvre have ears
and my house is my fortress, mes garçons, where all
obey me. There are no spies here.”</p>

<p>When he had composed himself, he sat and addressed
a letter to Coligny, acquainting him with
our arrival and asking him to come secretly under
the cover of night. The publicity of an audience at
the Hôtel de Châtillon could thus be avoided and
M. de Teligny did not doubt that, in view of the
importance of the matter, the Admiral would come
with all haste.</p>

<p>The Chevalier de Brésac was tireless. He worked
with a nervous energy which was most astonishing
in one of his slender frame. For my part I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
glad enough to seek some rest; for my ride of many
miles upon the back of a horse, my first journey of
the kind for years, had made me more stiff and sore
than when I had fought Don Diego de Baçan.
Goddard had long since been put to bed below
stairs. While I lay upon a couch, De Brésac wrote
steadily; seeking to place on record, in some sort
of order, the argument and statement of the case
for the Admiral. As he had aroused Henri de
Teligny, so he hoped to arouse Coligny; though
from what I knew of the man I had little thought
that this would be hard to do.</p>

<p>That night the Chevalier de Brésac repeated our
story to Gaspard de Coligny. The great Admiral
had thrown off his mask and cloak and sat in a
straight high-backed chair before the fire. He was
dressed solemnly enough in a suit of black, with
boots and slashed trunks. He wore a rolling collar
or kind of ruff; and a gold chain of fine workmanship,
the symbol of his rank, hung about his neck
and down his doublet. In stature he was tall,
though he seemed less so by reason of his head being
somewhat bowed in thought. His forehead was
lofty and wrinkled, but marked rather by the
weather than by the ravages of time. His hair was
plentiful but was cut short, standing straight upon
his head. A pointed white beard fell down upon
his breast. His hands grasped the straight arms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the chair as he looked forward into the fire. His
eyes, though clear and alert like those of a hawk and
seeming to look not at but through, had yet an expression
of sadness rather than severity. The light
of the fire, which was thrown up from below, shone
upon the cheek-bones and marked the deeper the
hollows below. At one corner of the mouth was a
great scar half-hidden by the mustache—a relic
of Montcontour—which made him to appear still
more gaunt and hollow-eyed. It was the face of a
keen, daring man, but not that of a cruel or even a
vengeful one.</p>

<p>The Chevalier stood a little to one side opposite
him, leaning lightly against the chimney-piece. As
he proceeded with the story the Admiral’s hands
gripped the chair-arms the harder and he chewed
nervously upon a toothpick, which he had put into
his mouth. For the most part he sat quiet, saying
no word; but when he heard of the promise of Menendez
for safe conduct as prisoners of war, he could
contain himself no longer. He got upon his feet,
walking up and down, asking short questions the
while to complete his view. De Brésac told all that
had happened much as I have related it here, save
only the parts which are intimate and personal
to me. When he described the patience and martyrdom
of Ribault and the others and the manner
in which they had met their doom, Coligny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
raised his hands to his brow, saying as though to
himself,</p>

<p>“It is not possible—not possible! I cannot believe
it!” asking questions until all doubt of the
barbarity had been removed from his mind. “It is
horrible!” he said. “Horrible, even now when
assassination is so much the fashion that it is the
argument of the fool and the wise alike.”</p>

<p>When De Brésac had finished, having spoken
of the good conduct of those who were lost and the
probable position of the survivors—were there any—the
Admiral remained silent awhile looking into the
fire, his hands clinched and his brows knit in a
tangled frown. He had quite forgotten us; for his
mind was fixed upon the bearing of this news upon
matters of State. No word was spoken and the
only sound in that great chamber was the crackling
of the logs upon the hearth. We saw by the look
upon his face how deep was his interest in the fate
of his poor colony, and we saw how the melancholy
was driven from his eyes by the expression of stern
resolve which suddenly fixed his features. It was
like watching a hericano drive up over a windy sea.</p>

<p>After a while he put again in rapid succession a
number of questions upon facts unconsidered by De
Brésac, which would have a certain diplomatic value
at the Court of Madrid. It was far into the night
when he had done, and he made no further statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and gave no opinion of any kind save at the
end, when his men had been called and he was about
to draw on his cloak.</p>

<p>“A great crime has been committed against duly-constituted
officers of France, my friends,” he said
gravely. “It is a matter in which the honor of the
King is concerned. It may not be overlooked, and
God alone knows what may come. You are to speak
no word of this affair, but must wait in readiness to
be called to audience with the King. You have done
well, Monsieur de Brésac. Good night, messieurs!
Monsieur de Teligny, good night.”</p>

<p>And so saying he disappeared down the stairway
and out a street door, muffling himself as he went.</p>

<p>De Brésac turned to me, his eyes glittering and
his lips set in a grim smile of triumph. “We shall
have vengeance upon them,—yes, we shall have
vengeance!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br />
<small>THE POET KING.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Not for two weeks did we have word or sign
from Admiral de Coligny; but at last a
messenger came speedily for De Brésac, who followed
in haste to the Hôtel de Châtillon. The
Admiral sought further information. Then there
was another long silence and our impatience was not
diminished when the report of the massacre got
abroad and a rumor came from Madrid that a vessel
had reached Spain from San Augustin and that the
messengers of Menendez to King Philip had been
received with great good will and circumstance. I
wished this business brought to a favorable conclusion,
but if naught were to come of it, I longed to
justify myself before Captain Hooper and would
rather have sought other employment at the Pelican
in Plymouth than to dilly-dally at the French
Court.</p>

<p>Yet what we saw and learned in this great city
of Paris was most instructive. Through the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
offices of M. de Teligny, and of Coligny, I had been
enabled to renew my costume; and Goddard had
been given a purse well-lined with pistoles, out of
which he had bought himself from a dealer in cast-off
garments a most gaudy vesture of red and yellow
velvet and silk, these being the colors most to his
liking. He had a gray, high-pointed hat, of a bygone
fashion, ornamented with a wide-flowing plume;
the breeches were most capacious and trimmed with
ribbons; the stockings were gray and the shoes
were high, ornamented with great flame-colored rosettes.
His sword was of a most prodigious length,
and though hooked well up by his shoulder straps,
clanked and clattered upon the paving stones like
that of a swaggerer of the Reiters. Much of the
time he spent below in the courtyard smoking and
conversing with La Chastro, the body-servant of our
host, a roystering man-at-arms who, second only to
Goddard himself, had the most voluble proficiency
in camp language I had ever heard. There upon a
bench in the sun the two of them would sit during
most of the day, the one rolling out his roundest,
mouth-filling speech, which the other would set in
some fashion into a language of his own. Goddard
had soon cut his hair short in the prevailing fashion,
and by the end of a week his upper lip was blue with
stubble which, with elbow aloft, he vainly strove to
stroke and twist after the manner of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raffinés</i> he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
had seen coming from the <i>levee</i>. When I, marveling
and curious at his wonderful jerkin and shadowy
lip, called him to me and asked him how it was that
he was turning frog-eater upon so short occasion,
he sent a great whiff of smoke from his pipe, saying,</p>

<p>“’Tis a wench, sir,—a most comely wench who
vows that ’til I grow a beard upon my face, she will
have none of me. ‘A man without hair upon his
face,’ says she, ‘is like a pasty without truffles.’
What think you of that for a saucy minx?”</p>

<p>I went off to the fencing hall. Here Pompée, the
maître d’armes to the King, sometimes gave a showing
of his art; and I picked up one or two tricks of
fence on the use of the dagger and had much interest
in some strokes which had come newly into vogue at
court. Once when we were returning thence, we
came to a small hostel before the door of which a
crowd had gathered. From within there was a babel
of voices and much laughter. A familiar odor saluted
my nostrils, for there was Job Goddard teaching
mine host the art of smoking. That ’twas not
altogether to the fancy of that worthy was readily
to be seen by the grimaces he made and the groans
which he let forth from his throat. But La Chastro
was behind him, the point of his rapier touching
the wide breeches, prodding at intervals between
the puffs to spur his energy. Goddard, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
his tall plume waving in the air, was standing in
front of him holding the reed within his lips and
saying,</p>

<p>“Suck,—suck my little pasty-flipper! Thus only
you may learn the virtues of the tabac. ’Tis none
so sweet as malvoisie, eh, my little wine-bibber?”
then, leaning forward, imitating the grimaces of the
rogue.</p>

<p>“Ventre de loup!” roared La Chastro. “So!
you do not like us to make a smoke in your house—eh?
You say we shall not! Quarrelsome little pig
that you are! Bah! Now puff! puff! puff!”—and
each time came a new prod in the breeches, making
mine host to writhe the more, though he puffed
and clung to the pipe which Job Goddard held, as
though death alone could separate them.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parbleu!</i>” said Goddard, “puff, and puff again!
’Twill make ye proof against the plague,—and other
things. Also it is of much benefit to the manners,
taking away all fretting an’ excitement. ’Tis a way
we have among the Caribs, when all is in agreement.
The pipe of peace is what ye smoke, me lad. When
’tis finished, no more discussion will there be atween
us.”</p>

<p>But the little man had no further humor for discussion
of any kind, for he turned the color of lead,
and, putting his two hands upon his wide paunch in
dismay, he spat forth the pipe and dashed frantically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
back among his pots and pans, La Chastro aiding his
departure with the toe of his boot.</p>

<p>The on-lookers roared with merriment, and Goddard
blew out some marvelous smoke rings from his
lungs, to the great delight of the wondering crowd.</p>

<p>So, after all, there was much to amuse and entertain.
M. de Teligny took us out upon the streets at
the hour of the afternoon when the world was
abroad, pointing out to us those of the courtiers
who were closest in the councils of the King. He
showed us the beauties,—and their lovers—and told
us the number of duels fought over each, and how,
the greater the number, the greater the fame of the
lady. Here was one favorite who numbered her
duels in the twenties; and there another poor
creature for whom but four men had fought, and
no person been killed. We saw little Comminges,
Prince of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raffinés</i>, who had more deaths to his
credit—or debit—than any man in France. He had
once taken a man out to the Prè-aux-clercs. When
they had uncloaked, he had said to his cavalier,
“Are you not Berny of Auvergne?” “No,” says
the other, “I am Villequier from Normandy.” “’Tis
a pity to have been mistaken,” said Comminges,
“but I have challenged you, and of course we must
fight.” And he killed him with a beautiful feint
and thrust in tierce. We passed the house of
Réné the Florentine, the poisoner for Catherine de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Medicis. We saw Thoré de Montmorency, “Little
Captain Burn-the-Benches”; His Grace the “Archbishop
of Bottles,” who by reason of the early hour
was still walking with much steadiness; the Count
de Rochefoucauld, nicknamed the “Cabbage Killer,”
who had ordered his arquebusiers to cut a plot of
cabbages to pieces, his poor sight taking them for
lanzknechts. There the Tuileries, just a-building;
and here the Louvre, where the King and the
Queen-mother were holding court. Once we saw
the royal cavalcade returning from the hunt at the
Château de Madrid, and the jerkin of the King was
covered with blood, it being his delight to kill the
stag with his own hands.</p>

<p>He seemed a young man fairly well set together,
but with a head put somewhat low and awkwardly
between his shoulders, the neck craning forward unpleasantly,
giving a lowering look to a figure otherwise
agreeable. As to his face, the forehead protruded,
and heavy ridges above the eyes gave notice
of a high temper; the nose was thick, and the upper
lip protruded, while the lower one fell away. The
eyes seemed of a greenish hue, and shifted from this
side to that; the skin pale yellow, which showed the
habitual derangement to which he was prey. But
it was not a harsh face—only stupid and wistful—truthful,
upon the whole, but weak; most unlike
Catharine, who once rode beside him—that Jezebel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
from Italy, who thought that to be honest was to be
a fool.</p>

<p>It was well into the month of January before
word came again from Coligny summoning us to the
Louvre. We knew that long communications had
been sent by both Charles and Catherine de Medicis
to Forquevaulx, at Madrid, asking reparation for
the slaughter at San Augustin. The Duke d’Alava
the Spanish Ambassador at Paris, had replied for
his sovereign that Philip considered the French
colonists pirates and intruders upon the domains of
Spain, and that there could be no reparation. The
position of Admiral Coligny was unchanged, and
there, so far as we knew, the affair rested. Now
however, we should perhaps learn something more.
The summons from Coligny excited hope.</p>

<p>De Brésac and I, with M. de Teligny, passed by
way of the Rue d’Averon and the Rue St. Germain
l’Auxerrois to the Louvre, over the moat
and through a stone arch into a great courtyard.
The place was alive with men in armor, but M. de
Teligny, having the entrée, was well known to the
cornet of the guard, and we walked up the wide
stairs to the Audience Chamber, where most of the
general business of the King, Queen-mother or the
Admiral was carried forward. The names of M. de
Teligny and of De Brésac having been passed by the
gentlemen in waiting, we were presently shown into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the anteroom of his Majesty’s apartments, where
Gaspard de Coligny was awaiting us.</p>

<p>He bore a most serious countenance as, dismissing
those about him, he arose to greet us. “The King
is within,” he said, “and I have wished him to see
and speak with M. de Brésac and M. Killigrew. M.
d’Alava has been here this morning and there is
news from Madrid.”</p>

<p>Not knowing what was desired of us, we entered
the King’s apartment after the great Admiral and
stood inside the curtains. The room had more the
appearance of an armory than of an audience chamber,
for about the walls there hung halberds, pikes,
spears, hunting horns, knives and arquebuses; while
upon the floor were saddles, a morion and breastpieces,
and a wolf-trap which his Majesty had but
just devised. Foils and masks lay upon a chair by
the chimney-piece, before which a great staghound
bitch lay sleeping upon the hearth-rug. Here it was
that the King took his fencing lessons with M. Pompée
and wrote verses with M. Ronsard.</p>

<p>His Majesty, his back toward the door, sat before
a table covered with books and papers, hawk-bells
and nets. He was leaning over, his elbow upon a
book, his chin in his hand, while his eyes in deep
thought were cast upward toward the ceiling. So
deeply engrossed was he upon the verses he was
writing that he was not aware of our presence until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the Admiral, waiting a moment, went forward and
spoke.</p>

<p>The King started from his reverie.</p>

<p>“Sire,” said Coligny.</p>

<p>“Ah, mon père,” he exclaimed, rising and stretching
forward a hand. “It is you? I was in a fine
poetic frenzy, was I not?”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty has a ready gift.”</p>

<p>“Come, my Plato,” said he joyously, “you shall
be the judge of how this couplet runs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Pour maintenir la foy<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Je suis belle et fidele.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“But your Majesty——”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Aux ennemies du roy<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Je suis belle et cruelle.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“’Tis for a new arquebus, monsieur, which the
armorer has made me. Think you not it has a glittering
ring?”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, Ronsard himself could not have
invented better. But this morning——”</p>

<p>“Think you so?”</p>

<p>“Sire, I have come this morning upon a State
matter of great importance.”</p>

<p>Charles dropped back into his chair.</p>

<p>“Matters of State! Matters of Court! Can I
never get away from this confusion?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The Admiral paused a moment, motioning us
forward.</p>

<p>“Sire, there is news from Madrid to-day, and
these are the gentlemen whom you wished to see,
M. de Brésac, M. Killigrew and M. de Teligny.”</p>

<p>For the first time the King looked around toward
us, smiling.</p>

<p>“Ah, M. de Teligny, I thought you boar-hunting
in the South.”</p>

<p>“I did not go, Sire. A touch of the wound I had
at Havre.”</p>

<p>“I have a great desire to hunt in the South.”
And then petulantly, “Well, well, mon père, what
is it this morning?”</p>

<p>“The matter of these Huguenots in Florida,
Sire.”</p>

<p>“I thought it would be upon some matter of religious
concern,” he muttered with a flash of ill-humor.
“Catholic and Huguenot,—Huguenot and
Catholic,—I am sick of you both.” Then seeing
that Coligny, looking at his papers, remained grave
and silent, the King sighed deeply and seized the
Admiral impetuously by the hand.</p>

<p>“Pardon, my brave Counselor. What is it that
you will?”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, this news from Madrid is serious.
In spite of your Majesty’s request of Philip of
Spain, M. d’Alava has replied for the second time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
that the blame of this massacre is upon the Huguenots
themselves. He says that the view of his
Majesty of Spain is that the blood of these Frenchmen
is upon the soul of Coligny, Admiral of
France, and that he, and he alone, should be punished.”</p>

<p>“You!—Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Sire, you shall see. Here are other communications.
One from Forquevaulx, one from other survivors
of the colony, and one from relatives of the
slain. Our Ambassador but repeats what D’Alava
has said and writes that so pleased is His Majesty of
Spain with the acts of this Menendez de Avilés, that
he has conferred upon him the title of Marquis of
Florida.”</p>

<p>“Foi de gentilhomme! It cannot be so!” said
the King.</p>

<p>“It is as I have said, your Majesty. The first
Spanish ship to arrive in the Biscayan ports brought
some of the officers of San Augustin, and they are
to-day the heroes of the hour in the Spanish capital.
They also hold certain prisoners who were spared
from the massacre, and these too have petitioned
you to secure their release. They are held as pirates,
which, as your Majesty well knows, they are
not.”</p>

<p>“Jour de Dieu!” shouted Charles, rising to his
feet. “I myself gave this commission under my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
own private seal. It is an insult which my brother
of Spain offers me, messieurs, an insult—to honor so
highly a man who murders my people!” He walked
up and down the floor, his hands behind him, his
brow clouded, the picture of resolution. Then by a
curious inconsistency, he leaned over the stag-hound
which followed him, patting it on the head and saying,
“Is it not so, Lisette?” as though matters of
State had vanished from his memory.</p>

<p>Coligny turned impatiently.</p>

<p>“Sire, I have also the narration of other survivors
and I would have you talk with M. de Brésac.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, by all means let us hear M. de Brésac.”
Whereupon, following the direction of the Admiral,
Brésac told again of the day upon the sand-spit before
the massacre, when Menendez had given Jean
Ribault his promise, under seal, to hold us as honorable
prisoners of war; of our desperate condition, of
the surrender and of the martyrdom.</p>

<p>Through it all the King sat nervously pulling at
his pen and looking at us, his eyes shifting uneasily
from the one to the other. Before the tale was far
advanced he had the appearance of one most <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuyé</i>
who wished to have the audience at an end at the soonest
possible convenience. That he and the Admiral
had been grievously and publicly insulted was a
matter most apparent; and yet all signs of anger
had disappeared from his manner, which was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
that of a lad awkward and ill at ease in the presence
of a company whose thoughts and mission he could
not comprehend. Doubtless Coligny understood
his mood better than we, but for my part he seemed
but as a child to deal with the great national disgrace
which was pending upon him if this disagreement
with the King of Spain could not be set speedily
aright. But suddenly, the horror of the deception
came upon him as it had upon M. de Teligny.
A phrase or a gesture of De Brésac caught his attention,
and he sprang to his feet in the intensity of
passion, striding up and down again, saying over and
over,</p>

<p>“It is monstrous! It is monstrous!”</p>

<p>He stopped as suddenly by the side of Coligny,
putting his hand upon the Admiral’s shoulder.
When the Chevalier finished, he said: “It is well,
M. de Brésac, you have served the Admiral well—and
you, M. Killigrew. You may be sure that this
matter is not ended here.” And then to Coligny,
“Did you not say, mon père, that there were other
reports of this unfortunate colony?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sire, and I will read.”</p>

<p>He seated himself and began, while Brésac and I,
uncertain whether the survivors were of the ships or
of the fort, strained forward to listen.</p>

<p>It was the narrative of Nicholas Challeux, the
carpenter. He spoke at some length of the happenings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
within the fort and of the attack by the Spaniards
which came at an early hour in the morning—at
dawn in a driving rain-storm. He himself was
surprised going to his duty, with naught but a clasp-knife
in his hand. Seeing no other means of escape
he turned his back and leaped over the palisade.</p>

<p>“I know not how it was,” said he, “unless by the
grace of God, that my strength was redoubled, old
man as I am and gray-headed, a thing which I could
not have done at any other time, for the rampart
was raised eight or nine feet.... Having then lost
all hope of seeing our men rally, I resigned all my
senses to the Lord. Recommending myself to His
mercy, grace and favor, I threw myself into the
wood, for it seemed to me that I could find no
greater cruelty among the savage beasts than that
which I had seen shown toward our people....
By and by I came upon the old crossbow-maker,
who was hiding in terror among some bushes, with
two gentlewomen, Madame de la Notte and her
daughter——”</p>

<p>“Diane!”</p>

<p>I started forward, with a cry which I could not
restrain. It seemed as though all my life-blood was
ebbing out of my finger-ends.</p>

<p>De Brésac put a hand upon my arm, while the
Admiral looked up from his papers sharply.</p>

<p>“You know——” he began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur. The wife and daughter of the
Vicomte de la Notte.”</p>

<p>“I thought him at Villeneuve,” said the King.</p>

<p>“Sire, he was with Ribault,” I said, my heart
bursting.</p>

<p>Coligny still paused.</p>

<p>“For the love of God, sir, read on,” I exclaimed,
forgetting the Presence and everything save that
we were there, speaking of the woman I loved—and
that she might still be alive.</p>

<p>The King smiled a little.</p>

<p>“You are impatient, monsieur,” he said, not unkindly.</p>

<p>“—Madame and Mademoiselle de la Notte,” continued
the Admiral, “who had been upon their guard
and had fled to the woods through a lower casement
at the first sound of danger. The rain was coming
down in torrents, but these women hid themselves in
the hollow of an oak tree. Madame de la Notte
could go no further, for she was terrified and sick unto
death. I threw some bark and brush-wood before
the opening to the tree, but heard the sounds of
the Spaniards coming and so fled away toward the
sea in company with the crossbow-maker, who was
weeping and wringing his hands——”</p>

<p>“The coward!” said De Brésac.</p>

<p>“I presently descried others, and came upon the
artist Le Moyne and a Flemish soldier carrying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
woman who had been wounded in the breast. Then
after toiling through a deep swamp we met Captain
Réné de Laudonnière, with whom we struggled
through the marshes in great distress to the vessel
of Captain Mallard.”</p>

<p>The Admiral paused, scanning the document.
“Um—ah. The remainder deals with the voyage
to Swansea in Wales, and is of no importance.”</p>

<p>“By my faith! Nor is any of it, save as information.
’Twas a most scurvy trick to lock those gentlewomen
up to die in an oak tree. Your carpenter
could better have learnt gallantry from the hardy
Flemish soldier whom he is at pains to describe.”</p>

<p>“And yet ’tis just such a place that these devils
might overlook,” replied Coligny. “Réné de Laudonnière,
who has sent me his report——”</p>

<p>“Ah, mon père,” said the King, rising abruptly.
“Shall you not spare us further reports this morning?
It will all be looked to in good time. You
shall prepare a plan and I will follow it. Will that
please you?” And then gaily, “As for me, this
morning, mon brave,—ah! I have so inventive a
humor that not less than three inspirations have
come to me while I have listened. My dear Ronsard
will be here within the minute and I have a
sonnet which I must write to him.” And then turning
to us, “Messieurs, you may be sure that nothing
will be left undone to secure the punishment of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Menendez de Avilés for the insult which he has
offered me and the people of France.”</p>

<p>And so we bowed ourselves out, I a prey to violent
emotion, De Brésac not knowing whether the King
were insincere or only a fool—M. de Teligny sure
that he was both.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a><br />
<small>I MEET THE AVENGER.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">My wound was open again. I had learned that
the carpenter Challeux had seen Mademoiselle
alive after the massacre at Fort Caroline, and
the tide of ebbing hope, ever restless as the moving
sea, flooded up again upon my heart and engulfed
me with tender memories. There was a chance—the
merest thread of doubt—which held and led
me willing captive amid the maze of uncertainties
which seemed to compass me about. Even as Challeux
had told, the story of Emola’s brave might still
be true. They had perhaps captured her and she
had died on the way to San Augustin! But the
ring might have been lost! She who was killed
might have been another! My lady may have remained
hidden secure in the great tree trunk where
Challeux had concealed her! She had followed my
advice to be on her guard; why might she not have
waited and fled by night to Satouriona? His camp
at that time, as she knew, was to the north, nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the Fort than that of Emola, where we had been.
If she had reached it, she would be safe as though
in England. For had not the great Satouriona,
marveling at her beauty, given her a necklace of
beads, saying that she was fair as the moon and
calling her the “Moon-Princess”? These strange
people would take her into their village and serve
her as they would one of their own blood, high in
the councils of their nation.</p>

<p>Ah! ’Twas sweet and holy thinking for me.
But alive or dead, my wish to cease this idle play
at service to the King and be up and doing something
to find her, or to avenge her death, came upon
me again strong as upon the sand-spit when my
heart beat high with hope. I must go back in search
of Mademoiselle. I could not wait with this fever
of hope burning into my heart. I wished now that I
had never left the country—that I had thrown in
my lot with the Indians and thus lost no opportunity
to hang upon the trail of the Spaniards and so have
learned the truth beyond any doubt. De Brésac
would say nothing. He merely shook his head, or,
sighing deeply, shrugged his shoulders. M. de
Teligny advised that I give up all hope of ever seeing
Mademoiselle again. So I had no encouragement,
save only that hope which came like an instinct
from my own breast.</p>

<p>The days dragged slowly by. Another messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
had been sent to Forquevaulx and another answer had
arrived from the Court of Spain. The whole affair
was now the property of the people, and in every inn
could be heard expressions of horror and consternation
from Catholic and Protestant alike. Charles
had written Forquevaulx in this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is my will that you renew your complaint, that
reparation be made for the wrong done me and the
cruelties committed on my subjects, to which I cannot
submit without too great a loss of reputation.
The Seigneur de Forquevaulx will not fail to insist,
be the answer what it may, in order that the King
of Spain shall understand that His Majesty of
France has no less spirit than his predecessors to
repel an insult.”</p></div>

<p>Brave words enough. Words indeed! Words were
made to hide the thoughts of courtiers!</p>

<p>Forquevaulx fulfilled his commission. Philip’s
only reply was to refer him to the Duke of Alava.</p>

<p>“I have no hope,” wrote Forquevaulx after this,
“that the Duke d’Alava will give any satisfaction
as to the massacre, for it was he who advised it from
the first.”</p>

<p>That was the news we heard, and that was like to
be the end of the matter. The King of France had
been three times insulted and now refused to raise
further voice in reply. Charles and the Queen-mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
would not quarrel with Spain, and all France
rang with the indignity. They had resigned themselves
to the affront. We saw the King almost daily
going to the hunt, a faint color stealing into his sallow
cheeks as he cantered down the crooked streets
with his brave following. Smiles wreathed the lips
where sternness should have been; and eyes that
should have wept his own heart’s blood danced and
sparkled with the joy and passion of the chase. It
was a grievous thing to see a man of his good
presence falling deeper and deeper under the blight
of his weakness. For all Charles cared, outraged
humanity might forever cry aloud, the blood of hundreds
of murdered Frenchmen might stain his very
hearthstone, and the proud standards of France be
lowered and trampled in the dust by the soldiers or
assassins of any nation of the earth. Was he not
the King? Was the stag-hunting not good? And
had he not written a sonnet to the eyes of Marie
Touchet and an ode to “Justice,” both of which
M. Ronsard had pronounced incomparable?</p>

<p>But there were still gallant men in France. Our
petitions and those of the relatives of the martyrs
were not to be made in vain. Upon the morning
of a certain day, while we were yet within
doors, came a gentleman asking for M. de Brésac.
He was a soldier of ancient birth and high renown,
named Dominique de Gourgues of Mont-de-Marsan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
De Brésac had served with him, and had told me something
of his vigorous fiery nature and life; how as a
boy he had been taken by the Spaniards near Sienna;
how with brutal insult they had chained him to the
oar as a galley-slave; how the Turks had captured
this vessel and carried her to Constantinople; how
they had put to sea again and were captured by a
galley of the Knights of Malta who had set the prisoners
free. De Gourgues had served in all parts of
the world and his reputation as a naval commander
in France was high—second only to that of the
martyred Ribault. He hated the Spaniards with a
mortal hatred and the tidings which we had brought
from Florida had set his hot Gascon blood a
boiling.</p>

<p>But I was ill-prepared for the figure he presented.
I had pictured him a great swarthy man built somewhat
upon the scale of Diego de Baçan, with a deep
roaring voice and the manner of a bravo. The person
I saw was none of this; for he was not large in
stature, having a figure tight-knit even to slenderness.
Yet it was plain to see he was built upon the
model of a hound, and that the muscles upon him
were as steel springs fastened upon a frame of iron.
His head was ugly beyond expression, somewhat in
the shape of a pear, with a wide bulging forehead, the
flesh falling away at the temples and cheeks almost
to emaciation. I looked in vain to his mouth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
chin for the force I could not find in his brows; and
then back to his eyes, where my gaze at last rested
enthralled. All else might have been as nothing and
those mysterious eyes would have revealed how deep
lay the soul of the man. I saw them not often in
repose upon this morning, for they were flashing
forth the fire that was raging in his heart; but
when he paused a moment they opened wide under
the broad brows,—melancholy, penetrating, but
frank, sincere and true; eyes to watch, to grieve, to
weep even, but not to deceive those he held in
esteem. His voice was not strident or harsh, even
as he spoke loudly, but soft as that of a woman.
But in it there was that note of command which no
man who has served with a great officer can ever
forget.</p>

<p>He bounded up the stone stairs, two steps at a
time, and came into the chamber with an unmistakable
vigor and firmness, as one accustomed and sure
of his welcome.</p>

<p>“Ah, seigneur,” he cried, espying De Brésac.
“Welcome to France!” And rushing to the Chevalier
he embraced him as a brother.</p>

<p>“Mon ami, you are new-come from Mont-de-Marsan?”</p>

<p>“This very hour, mon brave, and I have ridden
directly to you.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the Chevalier presented me to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
explaining that I was the Killigrew who had been
at San Augustin.</p>

<p>“Good!” he said abruptly. “Monsieur, I am
indeed fortunate. It is upon this very business that
I am come to you.” With an abrupt gesture he
threw his cloak aside and seated himself. Then
without ado, he began to speak.</p>

<p>“The King of France is a sluggard and a coward,”
he said fiercely. “He has bowed the head of every
honorable man in France upon the breast in shame.
I, who have been upon the soil of many countries,
have ever held my head aloft in pride; for I am a
Frenchman. That heritage holds enough honor
to place me among the ranks of the chosen of
the earth. Our nation is a brave nation and in our
land a man of honor dies rather than suffer a stain
to fall upon his name. The glory of our deeds has
resounded from one end of the world to the other,
and the lustre of our achievements has been like the
gleam of a shining blade in the fore of battle.”</p>

<p>He paused and then continued slowly, “M. le
Chevalier, that pride is gone; that heritage of a
good name,—an empty sound; that lustrous escutcheon,—beaten
to the earth, and dimmed and blotted
by the blood of our own kindred which has
flowed upon it.”</p>

<p>“God knows it is so,” said De Brésac.</p>

<p>“You of England,” he continued, appealing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
me, “know well that no insult such as this could
rest against the fair fame of your Queen, monsieur,”
and he rose from his seat. “Unless something is
done we are a people dishonored upon the face of
the earth.”</p>

<p>“The King has promised the degradation of this
Menendez,” said the Chevalier.</p>

<p>“His promises, like his verses, come ready made,”
sneered De Gourgues. “Pah! he is without candor,
this King;—without strength, without honor,—without
anything that men hold most high.” M.
de Gourgues was walking furiously up and down as
one possessed.</p>

<p>“Sh——” said De Brésac.</p>

<p>“I care not,” said the wild Gascon. “’Tis better
far to die, or to have no country. Spain insults the
King and the King is dumb. The nobles about him
are Italians in the Spanish interest. God save poor
France from her rulers now and ever, say I.”</p>

<p>Then he sat down and unburthened himself of
the object for which he had come to Paris.</p>

<p>“I am come,” he continued less wildly, “to ask
you to help me avenge this wrong—to raise again
the Standard of France from where it has been trailing
in the mud by Spanish feet.”</p>

<p>So rapid and fiery had been his speech that I could
not get the exact purport of his words. How he, a
simple country gentleman, could hope to embark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
upon so large a venture without King’s aid or commission
was more than I could readily comprehend.
Nor was De Brésac in any better understanding.
“But, monsieur,” he began, “if there were any——”</p>

<p>“Ah, Brésac,” he cut in, “you do not trust me.
You think I will not do as I say. As you will—I
tell you, I will destroy this Fort San Mateo if it
takes every crown and acre in Mont-de-Marsan!”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Chevalier, I am but a slow thinker.
I am with you if you will but give me half an earful
of your plans.”</p>

<p>“You will go?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart.”</p>

<p>“And you?”—to me.</p>

<p>“If not with you, then with some other,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Ah! Then that is done,” he exclaimed joyfully.
“Now to the plans. I believe in my company
first and my plans next. For plans are of no
use if there is no one to put them to practise. Here
is what I shall do. If during the week to come the
King of France does not obtain reparation from
Spain and the degradation of this monster, Menendez,
I will provide ships and men, and myself sail
for Florida.”</p>

<p>“But how?” we both asked in the same breath.</p>

<p>“My inheritance is for sale,” said this wonderful
man with a cunning smile, as though he were bartering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
a horse. “I shall obtain money from my
brother and any others who may still find a virtue in
honor. I shall have three small vessels with a hundred
arquebusiers and eighty sailors. Blaise de
Montluc, lieutenant for the King in Guienne, where
my brother has a high post, will give me a commission
to make war upon the negroes of Benin—to
bring them out as slaves, an adventure now held
most honorable—and then—then, voyez-vous, we
will go not to Benin, but elsewhere—where, we cannot
at this time precisely tell and so cannot inform
our valiant company—but to some place where
there is easy service and much profit. Is not the
plan a good one?”</p>

<p>De Brésac had listened, his eye kindling with enthusiasm.
He now cried out, “It is more than good,
it is wonderful! And upon my life, it succeeds!
You shall have—not two hundred men, but two
thousand—for by now there is not one Indian
friendly to the Spanish among all the tribes of Satouriona.
They will not live in subjection. I have
lived among them and I know.”</p>

<p>“Think you so? Then pardieu, ’tis simple as
plain sailing, and not one stone of this fort will we
leave upon another. There’s my hand on it. And
now adieu and for the present—silence!” So saying
he threw his cloak about him and went away as
quickly as he had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>So rapidly had the whole business been accomplished,
that when he had disappeared I began
wondering whether it were all true, or whether this
strange person were but a whirlwind creature of the
fancy. But there was De Brésac holding his hand
and looking at his fingers, which De Gourgues had
clasped.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Shall I ever straighten them?” he cried.
“He has the grasp of the Scavenger’s Daughter.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
This comes of being chained to a galley-oar. No,
’tis no dream. He will do what he promises, never
fear. ’Tis the most wonderful man this side of hell,
Killigrew!”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> An instrument of torture.</p></div>

<p>I laughed at his manner of expressing it. Yet I
did not doubt that it was so. For after De Gourgues
had gone, I could not cast from me the spell of
those melancholy eyes, and so great was his charm
and vigor that it seemed as if the spirit of vengeance
had been born again and had taken a new life in us
all. Here was a man to dare a chimera—to achieve
the impossible. Brésac and I embraced each other
and went flying to M. de Teligny to tell him of the
good fortune.</p>

<p>As I think of it now it seemed as though we
were going upon a journey for sport or play at
beast hunting instead of a deadly mission of death
and destruction upon men like ourselves. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
like the Avenger, there was no restraining us. At
last we had a champion—at last there was a plan—something
definite and certain in our minds, however
foolhardy, to lift us from this quiet and inaction,
this slough of despond, which, after our travail
and excitement, lay upon us and weighed us down
like a sickness.</p>

<p>M. de Teligny listened in surprise to the plan of
De Gourgues, his eyes sparkling with joy at the news,
for all the world like those of some old war-horse
champing at the bit and impatient for the scent of
battle. It was a great venture, he vowed, and much
honor would come of it. It was one of those expeditions
most to his liking, for were we not outnumbered
three to one? And would not all men rejoice
that we had wiped away a stain from the fair name
of France? He sighed deeply that he was worn in
years and service. But he would have gone had we
not shown him how much more we would have
need for men with all the vigor of youth, to strike
blows quicker and harder than had ever been struck
before.</p>

<p>The week passed, and the King was still busy upon
his hunting and ballade-making. No word came
from the Court of Spain and no word was given
forth at the Louvre for the people. The affront had
been passed over.</p>

<p>De Gourgues, not wishing that M. de Teligny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
should be implicated in his plots, came no more to
his house. Our meetings, which M. de Teligny attended,
however, were held in a small house just off
the Place St. Germain, where negotiations were conducted,
with the utmost secrecy. I had not acquainted
Goddard with our plans, for I knew from
what had happened in Dieppe that on any matter of
deep interest his tongue would wag in spite of himself.
I told him only that we were soon to depart upon
another mission to the New World. At which he
knew not whether to manifest most joy or sorrow;
for he was torn between a desire to remain at the
side of the damsel he had gained and the wish for
another packet of tobacco, as his own through much
squandering had been greatly reduced in size. Day
after day we saw our numbers slowly increase until
soon ten gallants, young and hardy like ourselves,
the rank and chivalry of France, were vowed to our
purpose. The Chevalier de Gourgues meanwhile
had entered upon negotiations for the sale of his
estates and had written to his brother in Guienne,
from whom after a time there came a reply most
encouraging, enclosing the commission from Blaise
de Montluc and an offer of money for the enterprise.
Fortune so far seemed to smile upon our efforts, for
nothing had occurred to mar our plans and all things
needful were readily procurable. Word came from
Bordeaux, where an agent of the Chevalier had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
been secretly at work, that several vessels lay at that
harbor which might be made to serve us admirably.</p>

<p>Twice M. de Teligny went to Admiral Coligny to
learn if despatches had passed between Paris and Madrid
and what was the disposition of the King. Each
time he came back with fury at his heart, saying that
the King had no humor for religious discussions.
But even had Charles shown a disposition to take up
his own quarrel, nothing would have deterred the
Chevalier de Gourgues from carrying out his plans,
upon which he had entered with a nervous energy
that knew no abating. By the end of a month or
so, all the necessary money having been secured,
De Gourgues and I set out for Bourdeaux to look into
the worthiness of the vessels upon which the agent
had reported. We found all three to be of small size.
One was somewhat larger than the others, being
built upon the plan of the vessels of the Levant,
propelled, if need be, by both wind and oars. The
two smaller ones were staunch enough and could
they hold all of our company, I did not doubt that
we might reach the Terra Florida in safety. They,
too, had banks of oars and this I considered to be a
matter of great value; for, the draught being not too
deep, all of the craft could be brought over the bar
and into the River of May if necessary. Arrangements
were made with a victualer that supplies to last
a year were to be set aboard; and arquebuses, morions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
pikes, and arbalests were to be procured. The agent
was instructed upon the class of men we needed and
notices were set up in the shipping towns for men
of youth, skilled in the use of pike and arquebus,
who wished a venture of a year which would be
attended with honor and profit. During the second
month of our preparations the word had gone abroad
that we were gold-seeking and many hundreds of
adventurers came beseeching De Gourgues to take
them. From these he picked out those he wished,
with the same skill and quick judgment that he used
in buying his hemp and oakum. He had that nice
eye for hardiness that Pompée had for a piece of
steel or Montmorency for a saucy bit of horseflesh.
Toward the end of April, De Brésac with Goddard,
and the cavaliers, rode down from Paris, and with
great rejoicing we all straightway entered aboard
the ships which lay, full victualed and supplied, at
anchor in the Rade.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a><br />
<small>WE SET FORTH AGAIN.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">The last figure we saw as the barges pulled away
from the pier was that of M. de Teligny
outlined against the sky, erect and soldierly, his
feathered beaver hat raised above his head in salute.
We gave him a round and hearty cheer, for we knew
how deep his heart was grieving for the youth that
was his no more.</p>

<p>By great good fortune I found myself with De
Brésac upon the larger vessel, which De Gourgues
had renamed the <i>Vengeance</i>. The two smaller vessels
were under the command of Lieutenant Cazenove
an officer of experience and devotion. With us was
François Bourdelais, a brother of the captain of the
<i>Trinity</i>, and four other gallants. Of arquebusiers
there were fifty, and of seamen there were a dozen
or more, including Goddard and a trumpeter named
Dariol, who had been with Réné de Laudonnière
and knew the Indian language better even than De
Brésac. These arquebusiers were a rough-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
lot—different in character from most of those who
had gone with Ribault—and De Gourgues, who knew
his Frenchmen, said with joy that he had never seen so
hard-hitting a company. I smiled a little as I looked
at them and he knew my thought, as he seemed,
through some operation of will, to know everything.</p>

<p>“Ah! M. Killigrew, you think them better let
loose upon the Spanish than upon us.” He laughed.
“True it is, mon ami, but they need only a little
prodding into shape. Take my word for it, these
are the only men for a venture such as this. Make
them forget the debt the world owes them, give them
a free swordarm and a Saint to swear by and they
will charge through an army of Dons and back again
for a faith which may set as lightly upon their consciences
as the skin upon their elbows.”</p>

<p>Our voyage was not to be so favorable as our
preparations. De Gourgues gave a rendezvous at the
River Lor, in Barbary, and we set sail upon a brisk
breeze. Before night, this wind blew up into a storm
which drove us into Rojan. Twice did we venture
forth, and each time were driven back, being at last
forced into the Rade at Rochelle, where we came to
anchor in the Charente and remained eight days.
This was a source of deep chagrin to De Gourgues
for our provisions were being consumed, while we
were coming no nearer to our destination.</p>

<p>For a few hours the storm abated, and with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
misgivings at the looks of the weather we put to sea
again and set our prows to the southward. But
hardly had we dropped the land into the ragged sea
behind us than it began to blow still more fiercely
than before. ’Twas more like a summer storm in
the tropics, and hardly to be understood so early in
the year, for the summer was yet a month away.
Nor was it a favorable augury for our voyage. We did
not know our men; and sea-people are of a wont
to put strange interpretations upon the movements
of the elements, so I feared that they would take
this misfortune as an evil presage of what was to
come. For two weeks off Cape Finisterre we were
tossed hither and thither at the mercy of the winds,
the waves running sprit-high, dashing in at the ports,
which had come loose, and flooding the lower deck.
It was in no manner so severe as the storm which
had driven the fleet of Ribault upon the beach, but
this <i>Vengeance</i> to which we had trusted our fortunes
was not the <i>Trinity</i> or the <i>Gloire</i>, and the buffets
which met us were short and severe enough to play
great havoc with the mind of a landsman. At last,
all sight of the vessels of Lieutenant Cazenove being
lost, and having had many small misfortunes—such
as the staving of one of our quarter-boats and the
loss of a piece of the bowsprit—the thing I had been
expecting came to pass. The arquebusiers mutinied.</p>

<p>The trouble came on an afternoon, the third week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
from the Charente. The men had gathered forward
in a seething group, with looks more lowering
than the clouds; and there was an ominous muttering
and a clatter of steel under the fore-castle, where
some of the arms were kept. Many of the rogues
were still sea-sick, and this made their tempers even
worse than they were wont to be. These sounds
and sights were most obtrusive where we stood upon
the poop, but De Gourgues had the appearance of one
most oblivious. He searched the sea line with his
glass for the lost sails, glancing ever and anon to
the westward, where the weather was showing signs
of promise; but no look would he give to the waist
or forward deck, where the men were scowling and
gesticulating among themselves. Not until the
sounds became too unruly to be mistaken did he
notice. Then laying his glass upon the binnacle, he
passed to De Brésac and bade him have two of the inboard
patereros loosed and trained upon the decks
below. The Chevalier and Bourdelais sprang to the
guns and in a moment had cast off the sea-breaching.
The rogues saw the movement, and, led by a tall
bearded scoundrel named Cabouche, came aft in a
most formidable array.</p>

<p>They had not passed the main-mast before De
Gourgues with a spring was down the ladder with
drawn sword, and single-handed stood face to face
with their leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Back!” he said in a voice of thunder. “Back
to your kennels, you dogs!”</p>

<p>I had never seen him thus. So entirely was he
transformed that he seemed a very demon of rage.
He was leaning forward as though crouching for a
spring. His voice was like the yelp of an arquebus
in the beginning of a battle. We could not see his
face, but it was plain it must have shown something
the rogues had not thought to see in one ordinarily
so melancholy and calm. They stopped as of one
accord, and looked from one to the other as though
some mistake had been made, each ready to accuse
his neighbor.</p>

<p>For Cabouche, the posture was more awkward.
He stood alone in the face of the enemy, plain to
the eye of every man upon the ship. He did not
see his comrades behind him; he only knew that did
he not make good his defiance, his position as bravo
upon that ship was gone for all. He lowered his
pike and came forward upon De Gourgues with the
rush of an angry bull. It was a terrible lunge that
he made. Armed only with a rapier as the commander
was, the blow would have done for any other
most surely. But De Gourgues stood firm, looking
at the fellow, the point of his rapier upon the deck.
He waited until the pike seemed almost to be touching
his doublet, when like the wind he sprang aside.
Then with a deft turn of his foot he tripped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
lout and sent him sprawling, so that he went into
the lee-scuppers and rolled with the wash of the
deck, cursing.</p>

<p>The mutineers, covered by our guns, remained as
de Gourgues had halted them, and stood as though
spellbound at the turn of the affairs of Cabouche.
One discharge and a sudden rush of our seamen and
cavaliers would have driven them below like sheep.
But there was need of none of this. De Gourgues,
holding up his hand to restrain us, stood swinging
with the slant of the deck, watching Cabouche, who
was rising from the scuppers, dripping with salt
water and swearing aloud that he was not yet done.
The man drew his dagger and came forward, moving
in a circle around De Gourgues, looking most
dangerous. The Chevalier stood this play for only
a minute, when, lurching forward like a flash, he
spitted Cabouche neatly through the hollow of
one of his great ears, and bore him back against the
fife-rail.</p>

<p>The rascal dropped his dagger, gave a roar of
pain, and sought to disengage himself. But his ear
was tough, and the Captain only pushed him the
harder, holding him spitted at arm’s length, talking
to him and examining him the while as though he
were an underdone fowl over a broiling-iron.</p>

<p>“Thou art satisfied, Cabouche?” he inquired in a
crisp, sharp voice. “Thou art satisfied? Wilt remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
upon this vessel? Or wilt thou go ashore?
Thou wilt remain in the fore-castle,—is it not so?
Thou wilt tell them,—thy mutineers,—that rapier
points and pike-points fly on end and bristle for such
as thee?” And here he cast him off against the
main-mast in contempt. “Bah! Cabouche,—thou
art but a poor pikeman. For there is much more to
learn in the management of the feet than of the
hands; and these things I will teach thee one day.
For the present, go below and wash the blood from
thy face. And if the lesson is not enough, I’ll have
an ear-ring for thee to match the hole I have made.
And ’twill be none so fashionable as those you wear,
I’ll warrant.”</p>

<p>The fellow slunk away from his look like a dog.
As for the other arquebusiers, most of them had put
their pieces back in the racks, and had gone about
their business.</p>

<p>I marveled at the skill of De Gourgues in catching
his man so nicely. But he only said, “’Twas most
simple; the rascal has the ears of a donkey—and the
stubbornness—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma foi</i>! But ’tis too brawny a fellow
to feed to the fish, and his hearing of my commands
will be all the better for a little blood-letting
in the ear.”</p>

<p>Afterwards, when I saw Mongol coins, thrown
about into the air, picked upon the point of his
rapier, through the square holes in them, I marveled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
no more at the ease with which De Gourgues had
spitted this Cabouche. It was the influence of his
look which I was at pains to understand. For
though I had seen and quelled mutinies such as this
three or four times in my life, I am at loss to describe
the power which lay behind the boldness,—power
felt by every man upon the ship. It was
the very witchery of fearlessness. Cabouche troubled
us no more; and in the end made a most excellent
soldier, hanging upon the looks and orders of the
Captain, and truckling as he had never before done,
either upon sea or land.</p>

<p>To our great joy, when we came to the rendezvous
we found our consorts awaiting us, they having had
little misfortune of any kind, and all being well. We
went ashore and rested; there, with water, game,
and fresh fruits, the men of the <i>Vengeance</i> were refreshed
and comforted until we set to sea again.
At Cape Blanco, where we anchored for the last
time upon the Afric coast, we were attacked by
three negro chiefs whom the Portuguese, jealous of
our vicinage to their fort, set upon us, hoping to encompass
our destruction. The black chiefs came
in long canoes with their men, but so warm was
their reception that, though they rushed upon us
twice, but one man reached the deck. This one
fought so gallantly that De Gourgues would not have
him killed. So we took him a slave to make good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
our commission from Blaise de Montluc. When the
chiefs found they could do nothing with us, they
went back to the Portuguese, leaving us the freedom
of the port.</p>

<p>Here again we filled our water casks, and then set
out across the great ocean. We drilled each day,
and so sweet was the weather that at no time were the
decks uncomfortable. Had De Gourgues the ordering
of the winds, they could not have pleased him
better, for ’twas a voyage of little event; and in
four weeks we came to the island called St. Germain
de Porterique, where we landed and rested again.
We sighted, and landed on La Manne and Saint
Dominique. In the first place, we met the King of
the island, who took us to his gardens, where lemons,
oranges, melons and plantains grew in great abundance.
He led us to his fountain, which he called
“Paradise,” and which he said would cure the plague
and the fever. The Chevalier gave him a bale of cloth,
and the chiefs loaded us down with fruit. At Saint
Dominique many of the people had been killed by
the Spaniards, and many had starved themselves to
death rather than be ruled by these people. They
made a perpetual war against the Spanish settlements.</p>

<p>“These men with long garments,” they said,
“came among us to teach us of their God and to
make us worship him. And they tell us that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
must hate the Devil. Their soldiers kill our children
and steal our wives, and they are cowards. For us,
if this is what their God teaches them, then we believe
that the Devil is the best. We adore him. He
makes men brave.”</p>

<p>We sailed on thus from island to island, taking
water and fresh provisions where we could, capturing
many sea-turtles so big that the flesh of one of them
would serve for sixty people at a meal, the shells
being of such a great size that large men could lie in
them, and so hard of surface that an arquebus ball
would not go through. When we reached Cape San
Antonio, which is at the end of the Island of Juanna,
we found a body of Spaniards drawn up on to the
beach to dispute our landing. These we defeated
after a brisk battle and procured the water of which
we were in need.</p>

<p>But during all this time no word had passed the
lips of De Gourgues as to the object of our voyage.
No slaves had been captured, save the one man who
had fought his way to the deck of the <i>Vengeance</i>.
When the men had wished to go into the interior of
the islands in search of gold, which the Caribs said
was plentiful, the Chevalier restrained them, saying
that the time was not yet and that their profit
would all come in good season. But he could not
much longer conceal his mission. Murmurs again
arose among the men of all of the ships; and though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
they went willingly enough about their duties, it was
plain that the desire to get upon shore could not
much longer be restrained. For discontent upon
ship-board is often less pleasant to live with than
ripe mutiny. So one day when we had arrived at a
point not eighty leagues from San Augustin, De
Gourgues called the companies of all three vessels
upon the decks of the <i>Vengeance</i>. The momentous
time had come. We knew not how much sympathy
or how little they would have with our cause and De
Brésac could not conceal his impatience. If De
Gourgues had any doubts or misgivings as to the
matter, he did not show them, but stood before the
soldiers and sailors upon the deck at the main mast,
an expression of great calmness and seriousness
upon his features.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen and brothers,” he began slowly, “the
time has arrived that you should know why we, men
of France, have come so far and braved so many
dangers under the shadow of the Western sun. The
God who rules the raging of the waters, who is the
God of all men upon the sea, has brought us safely
to this day upon a most just and righteous mission.
A foul crime has been committed against our beloved
France, mes braves. A year has passed and
no hand has been raised to cleanse our fair Standard
of the trail of blood which the Spaniards have
drawn across it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the men listened in silence. Then as they
comprehended, they looked at one another and the
name of San Augustin passed the lips of several.
Muttered curses broke from them here and there.
But in a moment even these few murmurs of anger
were stifled and borne away by the flood of the fiery
Gascon’s eloquence, as he told them in his own way
the story of the massacres at Fort Caroline and on
the sand-spit. As he went on his voice arose in
excitement until it rang out fair and true like a
clarion-call in battle, and his eyes were illumined
with the light of his inspiration, as he painted the
worst horrors of those scenes as I have not dared to
paint them here. He told his men that this alone
was his purpose, and that he had chosen them from
among hundreds of others because they were the
men who could best defeat twice their own number.
And knowing that the duty before them would be
attended with great travail he knew that he should
not fail in the hour of danger.</p>

<p>“What disgrace,” he cried at last, “if such an insult
should pass unpunished! What glory will there
come to us, if we avenge it! To this venture I have
devoted my fortune. The vessels upon which you
float are mine. The morions and the pieces on your
backs are mine! Your weapons,—mine! All mine
to avenge your soldier brothers! From the first I
have relied upon you, even when you did not trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
me. I have thought you jealous enough of your
country’s glory to sacrifice life itself in a cause like
this! Was I deceived? Must the bodies of your
soldier brothers swing like thieves from these wild
fir trees, the brand of shame upon them, food for
crows and vultures? Will no one cut them down?
My men, I am here to show you the way,—I will be
always at your head,—I will bear the brunt of
danger. Will you refuse to follow me?”</p>

<p>Never had I heard such an impassioned voice, and
the spirits of the men, doubtful and restless at first,
burst from a spark into a flame at his words, and at
his last appeal their response rose in a roar that
seemed to shake the firmament.</p>

<p>“A la mort! To the death will we follow
you!”</p>

<p>It was a wonderful scene. No English company
would have changed so quickly to the fury of enthusiasm
that possessed them. They threw their
caps into the sea and began heaving up the anchor.
Many of them crowded around our Captain, begging
that he would take them to Fort San Mateo and
lead them at once. It was with great difficulty that
he could get them to listen to him; but at last,
quiet having been in a certain measure restored, he
told them that they would sail through the Bahama
Channel—which was most treacherous—at the full
of the moon. It would be folly to take any risk at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
this time, when a mistake would bring to naught
the planning of months.</p>

<p>“The time will come soon enough, my friends, for
there is much to be done. To-night or the night
after, if the weather be fair, we shall sail. In a
week, with Gods help, Ribault will be avenged.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br />
<small>WE FORM AN ALLIANCE.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">That night as we slowly crept up the Bahama
Channel under the resplendent tropic moon,
I told my story to De Gourgues. He heard it
throughout, saying no word but sighing now and
then, his melancholy eyes looking down the glimmering
streak, into which we were sailing as into a
glory. That this strange man had once been loved,
and had passionately loved in return, I did not doubt;
for despite his ugliness of visage there was that in
his expression which would command the adoration
of women, who often reckon deeper than by mere
lineaments of feature; and softly illumined as he
was by the pale and ghostly translucence of the
night, I thought no more of his ugliness, but of his
soul. For he was transfigured, and looked in his
calmness even as he looked in all the majesty of
passion, inspired and of this world a thing apart.</p>

<p>When I had done, he put his hand upon my shoulder,
saying,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is not often that Englishmen love as do you,
my friend. Build not your hopes too high, for you
have suffered much to suffer so much again. It
will not be long before we shall know—we shall
know——” and he paused, sucking in his lip ominously.
After that he took my hand and said,</p>

<p>“I have taken a great fondness for thee, mon ami;
and our solemn duty performed, what can be done
shall be done, upon that you may rely. We will
first sail to the northward of the River of May to the
Indians of Satouriona. If what the Chevalier de
Brésac says be true, they will be willing allies upon
this expedition.” De Brésac, hearing his name
spoken, now joined us.</p>

<p>“We were wondering, seigneur, how great a value
to set upon these Indians of yours,” De Gourgues
said.</p>

<p>“I have ventured but an humble opinion, my
Captain,” replied Brésac, “but I would stake my
honor that there is no love lost between Satouriona
and De Baçan.” De Baçan, the despatches had said,
was the new-appointed Commander at San Mateo.</p>

<p>“I pray God that it may be as you say. For a
palisaded fort of stone with half a thousand men is
no slight obstacle even for the brave fellows of the
fleet of the <i>Vengeance</i>.”</p>

<p>“All of us who have been at Fort Caroline know
of the love which the great Paracousi bore for Jean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Ribault. Dariol, the trumpeter, who was with the
first expedition, has lived among them longer than
I; and he has boasted that he will go among them
without fear.”</p>

<p>“It is in my mind to sail directly to the country
of this chief; his boast may not prove an idle one,”
replied De Gourgues. And then to the guard, “Pass
the word below to Dariol the trumpeter. We shall
see.”</p>

<p>Presently the man came from the fore-castle and
stood before us.</p>

<p>“You have no fear of the Indians of Florida,
Dariol?” asked De Gourgues.</p>

<p>“None more than I have of M. Killigrew or M.
de Brésac, my Captain,” replied the man with a
smile.</p>

<p>“You have lived among them longer than M. de
Brésac?”</p>

<p>“A year and more, my Captain.”</p>

<p>“They were friendly to M. de Laudonnière?”</p>

<p>“Until the madness for gold, when his soldiers
broke faith with them.”</p>

<p>“And Monsieur Ribault?” asked de Gourgues.</p>

<p>“Satouriona thought the Admiral a great chief,
M. le Chevalier. They swore an eternal friendship.”</p>

<p>“M. de Brésac says you speak their language,
Dariol.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“As I do my own.”</p>

<p>“You know their customs. How think you they
will look upon our landing?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” replied the trumpeter firmly, “I believe
with M. de Brésac that if they think us Spaniards
they will dispute our landing. If we prove
ourselves Frenchmen and friends, they will receive
us with gladness.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“It is my belief that they hold the Spaniards in
great enmity. For no arrogance will be borne by
Satouriona. He is a great King, with great pride of
spirit, and numbers his people by many thousands.”</p>

<p>“But the Spanish have friends among the Indians?
M. de Brésac has said so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my Captain. But they are the false-hearted,
dirt-eaters of Outina. Against these, Satouriona
wages a war more fierce even than against the
Spanish.”</p>

<p>De Gourgues stroked his mustache, saying,</p>

<p>“When we reach the coast, I will call for you,
Dariol. For the present, that is all.”</p>

<p>The man saluted and went below.</p>

<p>“Par la mort, his words ring true as steel,” muttered
De Gourgues. “If these Caribs are valiant, as
he says, we will sweep this scum of pestilence from
off the western land.”</p>

<p>The next day at noon we sighted the coast of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Terra Florida, and at the thought of all Diane had
suffered there my heart welled full of emotion. Now
as we came nearer and nearer our mission’s ending,
the cloud fell down upon my spirit again, and the
same struggle between hope and fear—of pain which
is the price of joy—tossed me to and fro—held and
freed me, like the embrace of some temptation. The
sun was yet above the foreyard when we came in
sight of the River of May, but De Gourgues, wishing
to reconnoiter, stood on until sunset, when we were
within less than three leagues from the coast. Suddenly
we saw several puffs of smoke spurt from the
beach as the Spaniards, suspecting no enemy, fired
their cannon in salute. Not until then did we know
of the new defenses which the enemy were putting
upon the shore at either side of the river’s mouth.
Our three vessels, to better keep up the guise of
friendship, boomed forth a salute in reply, after
which we put out to sea again and soon lost the
shore line in the rapidly falling dusk.</p>

<p>The river that the Indians of Satouriona call Tacatacourou,
after the name of their second greatest
warrior, enters the ocean by two mouths at a distance
of not more than fifteen leagues to the northward
of the River of May. Within the bar there is
a safe harbor, and it was for this haven that Dariol
and the Chevalier de Brésac were directing our
course. But not wishing to pass over the bar until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
day, De Gourgues held out to sea, not coming in
sight of land again until well into the forenoon.
Then, the river entrance being easily discerned, he
put his helm over and entered the channel, coming
safely to anchor at an early hour of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Now that we had come to our journey’s ending
there was a great stir and excitement aboard the
little vessels of the fleet. The arm chests and ammunition
lockers were opened and all hands put
merrily to work setting the arquebuses to rights,
fixing new match cords, seeing to the barrels and
rests that no disaster might befall them by reason of
any negligence of their own. The grinding stones
were brought out into the sunshine of the open deck
and the grit of the polishing steel and the rattle of
the pike heads made music brave and martial to
the ear. The seaman sang about their work as
the lighter yards came clattering down upon the
deck, and the culverins, unharnessed from their sea-apparel,
shone anew in the brightness of the summer
sun. The shore upon both sides was plain to the
view at a distance of half a league, and once or
twice we saw the dusky figures of Indians upon the
beach. Bourdelais and one or two of the gallants,
unaware of the plans of De Gourgues, were for going
ashore at once and giving battle; but he was in no
haste,—when he was ready for all emergencies he
would go, and not before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Night fell again; and with the coming of dawn a
great surprise awaited us, for in the gathering light,
we saw that the beach was alive with savages. They
made no sound but stood in groups as far as the
pines, where they were lost in the misty shadows of
the forest behind them. Here and there a figure
was moving from one group to another, and we knew
that their runners had gone out to the nearer villages
and that they had assembled to combat our landing.
De Gourgues frowned as he came upon deck.</p>

<p>“Crebleu!” he scowled, “there must be three
thousand of them at least. Fools that they are! I
have no men to waste upon such carrion as these.
You are a wise soothsayer, M. de Brésac!”</p>

<p>“Monsieur!” replied the Chevalier with some
dignity, “I have only replied to your questions
with the best of my understanding.”</p>

<p>“But these red devils,” De Gourgues continued,
“are armed to the very finger-nails. They look from
here little like the allies you have promised us, M.
de Brésac. Ho! Dariol, come aft!”</p>

<p>De Gourgues was striding up and down in a ferment.
He saw his anchors gone and his plans set
adrift by this unexpected resistance. When Dariol
came, he stopped before him savagely, and pointing
to the dark mass upon the beach said with scorn:</p>

<p>“Look you, master trumpeter, at your friends
yonder! Look, I say! Must we cut our way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
through all this red vermin before we may reach the
Spanish Fort? Explain it,—if you can. What has
happened?”</p>

<p>Dariol wore a most serious face.</p>

<p>“The matter is bad, my Captain, for these Indians
are surely bent upon war——”</p>

<p>“Well!”</p>

<p>“If we cannot prove our friendship we shall not
land without a battle.”</p>

<p>“’Tis plain as a pike-handle,” said Bourdelais.</p>

<p>“A pretty pickle, sure enough——”</p>

<p>“M. de Gourgues, had you thought,” interrupted
De Brésac quietly, “that they may take us for Spaniards?”</p>

<p>“But even so——”</p>

<p>“Seigneur, I am willing to take a risk. If Dariol
will go with me, I will go to the beach asking for
Satouriona——”</p>

<p>A murmur arose among those within hearing. It
seemed to many a most daring thing to offer; for to
our people, many of whom had never passed the
borders of France, these Indians were as wild beasts
or Africans, fit only to be shot or captured as slaves.
For me, I believed with Brésac and having been at
the council table with Satouriona I foresaw little
harm if he were put among the natives upon the
beach. So when Dariol had said that he would go,
I too offered my services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>But De Gourgues in his uncertain and dangerous
mood was of a different mind.</p>

<p>“I have no humor to lose all my men upon such
a fool’s venture,” he said. “Dariol may go, if he
have the hardihood. M. de Brésac——”</p>

<p>“Seigneur,” interrupted the Chevalier, “this man
must be rowed ashore. He cannot talk and make
signs to these Indians, rowing at the same time. It
is I who first offered this service.”</p>

<p>De Gourgues frowned, debating for some little
time, but at last gave orders that a boat should be
lowered into the water. Every persuasion that
I might, I used upon him until I saw that further
argument was mere waste of words. He would not
let me go.</p>

<p>“No,” he said shortly, “we are already too small
a number. Were you to go I should be sending—not
three, but six, men—and that were already four
too many.”</p>

<p>With great anxiety he watched Dariol and De
Brésac drop down into the boat. They had no weapons
and had removed their doublets to row the
better. Dariol had put in the bow a number of
small trinkets, such as mirrors, knives and strings of
beads, with which he hoped to show the signs of
friendliness. The morions of our arquebusiers lined
the bulwarks, for the company thought these two
men were going most surely to their death. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
word was spoken and the sound of the oars plashing
in the quiet water of the harbor came down clearly
upon the breeze from the land as the little craft drew
nearer the shore. When half the distance had been
traversed we saw Dariol lay down his oars and stand
up in the bow shouting, “Antipola! Antipola!”
waving a string of beads in his hand. This brought
forth a chorus of cries from the beach, and the savages
came down to the water’s edge shouting and
waving their bows. But De Brésac, at the oars, not
even turned his head at the outcry. He bent
steadily to his work like a London waterman, sending
the boat at each stroke nearer and nearer the
moving crowd.</p>

<p>The excitement upon the ship was intense, for in
a moment the craft would be grounded upon the
beach in the very midst of the enemy.</p>

<p>“Most gallantly done,” said De Gourgues, beside
me, below his breath.</p>

<p>Dariol began shouting again, asking for Satouriona,
but in the commotion we could not hear what
further was said. Then something happened; for
we saw a tall figure come out to his waist in the
water, holding up his hands before him. In a moment
the boat disappeared in the human wave that
engulfed it as the Indians surrounded it upon every
side, seizing the gunwales and running it up on the
beach. It was a most confused mass and we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
make out little of what was going on. A fellow up
forward shouted, “They have killed them! They
have killed them!” and a great cry arose on the
<i>Vengeance</i> which drowned the yelling of the savages
upon the shore. Some of the Indians were jumping
into the air and throwing their bows aloft; and
Bourdelais, who was looking through the glass, said
haltingly,</p>

<p>“I see them—there is the shirt of De Brésac.
Three of them are holding him—no—they are,”—and
then excitedly, “upon my faith—they are clasping
him by the hand—they are touching Dariol upon
the shoulders. It is friendship—seigneur—friendship!”</p>

<p>De Gourgues snatched the glass from Bourdelais’
hand and fixed it quickly to his eye.</p>

<p>“You are right, Bourdelais. They walk up the
beach, my comrade! They converse together. Ah!
it is well.”</p>

<p>It was now patent to all on board the <i>Vengeance</i>
that no harm had befallen our comrades, and
there was great rejoicing. For there in plain sight
walked Dariol and De Brésac talking with the Indian
who had walked into the water, who, by his stature,
wide shoulders and dignified bearing, I made out to
be none other than Satouriona himself.</p>

<p>After awhile we saw the boat push off from the
shore and make for the ship. Dariol and De Brésac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
rowed; in the stern we marked the figures of Satouriona
and several dusky savages. At this De
Gourgues ordered the company to be drawn up upon
the deck, and prepared to welcome his strange visitors
over the side with all the state and formality
he would have shown a King of France. It was a
course which diplomacy suggested.</p>

<p>I had not before seen Satouriona in his war dress,
for at Fort Caroline he and his braves had come
smoking the pipe of peace and wearing a small headdress
and only the <i>aziam</i>, or breech-clout, upon the
body. As his broad shoulders rose above the bulwarks,
we saw that his hair had been lifted upon his
head, and two eagle’s feathers painted with streaks
were stuck upon it. Upon his breast was painted a
picture of one of those beasts which had so frightened
us in the swamp—an alligarto—which was the
totem of his tribe. Streaks of red and white paint
were drawn upon his face, making his features fierce
and threatening. I should not have known him but
for his bearing, for at Fort Caroline I had thought
him a most comely savage, rugged and strong-featured,
but of a great calm and dignity. Behind
him walked Olotoraca, a young brave, his nephew,
and Tacatacourou, the second great chief of the
tribe. They bore no weapons, but walked past the
ranks of the pikemen and arquebusiers, making no
sign of any emotion as they went with De Gourgues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
below to the cabin. Here he had caused a feast of
wine and preserved fruits to be set forth, of which
the Indians took sparingly. After this Goddard’s
pipe and what remained of his tobacco was brought
forth, and De Gourgues, lighting it, himself passed
it to Satouriona, who solemnly puffed it and handed
it to his neighbor.</p>

<p>De Gourgues’ luminous eyes went from one of
the chiefs to the other, as he considered the words
best to use in the delicate business before him.
Dariol stood behind his chair ready to interpret.</p>

<p>“I have come to the country of the great Satouriona,”
he said at last, “to bring him presents and
to continue that friendship which was begun by the
great white chief, Ribault.”</p>

<p>Satouriona nodded gravely. “So it has been said.
I and my people are glad.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, great chief, in the name of my
country and of my great master across the water,
who in love and good will has sent me,” said De
Gourgues, from necessity speaking of the King of
France. “He has sent me to give you many gifts
which will be useful in your lodges as well as in
the hunting. My master knows of the kindness of
the great Satouriona to his servant Ribault, and
prays that this good-will and friendship will continue
through the passing of many years.”</p>

<p>Satouriona arose with great dignity and spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
His heavy voice, made to resound under the vaulted
arches of the forest, rang mellow and deep in the
little cabin.</p>

<p>“I have said to the great white chief Ribault that
the sky shall fall upon the earth sooner than I will
become an enemy to the people of your nation.
Since the great stone house was taken by these dark-bearded
ones there has been no happy day among
the people of the nation of Satouriona. The sun
hides his face behind the clouds, and the flowers and
fruits have ceased to blossom and to ripen. There
is a blight upon all the land, and the rivers and
streams dry up like the blood which flows from our
hearts. The Spanish have beaten us back with
their sticks which speak a loud noise, and they have
burned our cabins. They have ravished our wives
and daughters, they have killed our children; and
our hearts are heavy and ready to burst within us
for shame and anguish.”</p>

<p>Satouriona paused to give his speech a greater
value.</p>

<p>“All this we have suffered because we loved the
great white Paracousi, Ribault. But now the end
has come. We can endure it no longer, and we shall
make a deadly war against them until the tribe of
Satouriona is no more or the people with the black
beards are beaten back into the sea out of which
they came.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Again fortune seemed to be favoring us. The display
of force was meant for our enemies, not for us.
We knew the joy De Gourgues must have felt; but
no sign of it showed upon his face. In Europe his
reply would have been called diplomacy.</p>

<p>“It is a great sorrow to me, O, Paracousi! that
the love which Satouriona bears my people has
brought ill treatment upon his tribe. But such
things shall be no longer. If his nation has been
abused for the love of the French, then the French
will be his avengers.”</p>

<p>As this was interpreted by Dariol we watched the
face of the Paracousi. Slowly, as the truth of what
had been said dawned upon him, Satouriona arose
from his seat and leaning forward upon the table,
looked over at De Gourgues, a broad smile upon his
face.</p>

<p>“What!” he exclaimed, “will you fight the
Spaniards?”</p>

<p>“I came here,” replied De Gourgues, rising, “only
to reconnoitre the country and make friends with
you, and then go back and bring more soldiers; but
when I hear what you are suffering from them I
wish to fall upon them this very day, and rescue you
from their tyranny.”</p>

<p>The effect of this speech upon these Indians was
great. Their faces, usually stolid and expressionless,
broke into smiles; and all their dignity and quiet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
swept away by the joyful tidings. Their voices rang
through the narrow cabin as they rose to their feet
and in rough gutturals and cries of their own wildly
applauded the words of the Avenger. It was some
moments before quiet was again restored, for so great
was the joy of Satouriona that he had no better
control upon his composure than Olotoraca, the
youngest of his chiefs.</p>

<p>When the Indians were seated again De Gourgues,
raising his hand commanding silence, continued.</p>

<p>“It is most certain, O, Paracousi! that this expedition
is no play for children; for those we must fight
are sturdy men, well armed and sheltered in a fort
built of many thicknesses of stone. You must
summon the greatest chiefs and braves of your tribe,
so that we shall make good our promises. We do
not covet all the honor of this victory, and will share
that as well as the spoils of the battle with you and
your people.”</p>

<p>“We will go,” replied Satouriona, solemnly uplifting
his hand, “we will go and die with you, if need
be!”</p>

<p>“It is well. There should be no delay. If we
fight we should fight at once; for it will not be
many suns before the black-beards will know that
our great white canoes have anchored near their
fort. This should not be, for what we do, we must
do in secrecy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>When this was rendered into his language,
Satouriona drew his knife from his belt,—leaned
forward, lifting his hands and elbows, crouching, the
very picture of keenness and stealth. His voice was
low and threatening like the murmur of the rising
storm in the tops of the giant firs of the seashore.</p>

<p>“Do not doubt,” said he. “Do not doubt we
hate them more than you can do.”</p>

<p>After this there followed a long discussion upon
the best method of attack upon the Fort, Satouriona
asking but three days to send his runners to outlying
villages that there might be no lack of warriors for
the expedition. It was decided by De Gourgues to
send three scouts at once to learn the strength and
position of the two forts at the river’s mouth as well
as many details of the new armament of Fort San
Mateo.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />
<small>OLOTORACA.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">During all this talk, my mind in a ferment, I
was forced to sit with elbows glued to sides,
unable to put the query for Mademoiselle which
trembled upon the lips even as I listened to what
was going forward.</p>

<p>I had kept my eyes upon Olotoraca, the nephew
of the great chieftain, as he sat leaning forward with
hands upon his knees listening to the words of
Dariol. ’Twas a wonderfully handsome face and even
the hideous streaks of crimson upon it could not disguise
the regularity of the features and the expression
of candor and fearlessness which animated them;
and the pride of his port was that of a prince, heir to
some great kingdom. As he glanced about the cabin
from time to time I caught his eye and gave him a
look of welcome which he returned with a smile.
The sun coming in the after-port lit up the scarlet
streaks upon his face and head-gear and penetrated
the ferocious disguise, reducing him after all to his
proper dimension—a fine, brave lad of five and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
twenty, who if born an Englishman would have
served his queen with honor and profit.</p>

<p>So I took a mind that this Olotoraca should be
the one with whom I would speak of Mademoiselle.
Not until the planning and discussion of the attack
upon Fort San Mateo had become general could I
get the ear of De Brésac and then I told him what
was in my mind.</p>

<p>“Olotoraca,” said Brésac, when at last we had
come together, “it will not be many suns ere your
crest will wear another eagle’s feather. You will go
upon such a warpath as was never known among
the tribes of Satouriona or Tacatacourou; and when
you come back to your village there will be many
trophies upon your girdle and you will be a great
chief among your people.”</p>

<p>His eyes shone as he said simply, “It is so—or
I shall be dead.”</p>

<p>“You may one day be Paracousi of all your nation.
After the great Satouriona is gone, it is to
you that our people will look for the friendship
which has been begun to-day.”</p>

<p>“The Paracousi Satouriona and Olotoraca are one
in all their thoughts. For is it not from him that
Olotoraca has learned the signs of the forests and
the medicine of his tribe? How shall he change
what Satouriona has done? What Satouriona does
is good, and shall not be altered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is wisdom, Olotoraca. For the French are a
great people and they love their friends with their
whole hearts. At Fort Caroline Monsieur Killigrew
and I have fought the Outinas and the Spaniards for
Satouriona; and soon our chief with the pale face
will revenge the insults and abuses which the Black-beards
have put upon you.”</p>

<p>The young brave at the mention of the name of
Killigrew had sent his cold glance upon me with
startling abruptness as though to pierce me through.
For the nonce he was a wild animal of the forest
again. Then he looked calmly at De Brésac.</p>

<p>“Keel-ee-gru—the pale giant is called Keel-ee-gru?”
He muttered the words half aloud, half to
himself and then tossed his head so that the bear-claws
rattled about his neck.</p>

<p>“You have heard my name?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The Captain Keel-ee-gru is a friend of the Paracousi
Emola. A friend of Emola is a brother of
Olotoraca,” he replied easily.</p>

<p>A look passed between the Chevalier and me.
There was that in the manner of Olotoraca which we
could not understand. But De Brésac had made a
quick theory of his own, and acting on it as was his
wont, he put his hand upon the muscular shoulder of
the young warrior, turning him about and looking
him steadily in the eyes.</p>

<p>“We believe in the truth of the things you say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Olotoraca, and for our part we will keep our promises.
But you, what have you done for us since
we have been away? What will you do for us when
we are gone?” The Indian did not look at De
Brésac, but straight before him.</p>

<p>“We will keep friendship as we have ever done,”
he said evenly, “asking no more than we can give.”</p>

<p>“You have kept friendship with our people?”
said the Chevalier craftily, and I saw his drift. “Then
you have among you those who escaped from Fort
Caroline!”</p>

<p>A great change came suddenly over the face of
the young brave. He flashed the eye of a hawk
first at the Chevalier and then at me. De Brésac
was impassive. I was leaning forward, the query that
was vexing my soul hanging upon my tongue. His
face lost the boyish look and in a moment became
again as it was when he mounted the entering
ladder—haughty and immobile.</p>

<p>“There is but one of your race among us,” he
said, carelessly, “a youth who calls himself Debré.
He is at the village of the Paracousi Satouriona and
will be brought hither on the morrow.”</p>

<p>It all happened thus as I have written it. ’Twas
but a second of time that his eyelid fluttered at our
sudden query as he sought to gain his composure.
But in that brief moment there was that which
showed us that the personal friendship which this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
young brave avowed was no friendship at all, but
only breath upon his lips and in no manner to be
believed. If something had happened to make the
Indian distrust us, ’twas no good beginning for our
foray. And these doubts must speedily be cleared if
success was to attend our undertaking. For my
part I was so sure Olotoraca was lying, that I made
myself no concern over his denial. A French youth
named Debré had escaped and had been cared for.
Then why not others? If Satouriona was a friend
of the French, then all refugees should be safe in his
lodges.</p>

<p>After the Indians had been set ashore again and
De Gourgues had been told of the manner of Olotoraca,
he stroked his chin gravely.</p>

<p>“You are certain of some deception? H-m! That
is strange, for I have found a great frankness in the
manner of the Paracousi. But it may be as you
say—and we will be upon our guard against him. ’Tis
most certain that these Caribs do hate the Spaniards
with a mortal hatred and we must show no doubt of
them until our mission is accomplished. So I say,
do nothing to gain their enmity, even should you
believe that friends of yours are in their keeping.”</p>

<p>These were orders and he spoke them firmly. But
all night long I strode up and down the deck under
the deep vault of starlit sky, trying to hit upon some
plan by which I could learn the truth. Why had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Olotoraca started at the mention of my name?
Emola had spoken it, he said, but my return to
Florida should be no cause for alarm or even surprise
to him, since in the presence of that chief we
three, De Brésac, Goddard and I, had sworn to visit
vengeance upon the Spaniards, and Emola knew
that we would return as soon as could be. Unless
our judgment was at fault there was some matter
of common interest between this young Carib
prince and me. For the chance perception which
had enabled us to pierce the weak spot in his armor
had shown that there was something in his mind
against me, which in spite of his accustomed immobility
he could not hide. What could it mean? The
instinct of battle and the desire to measure my
strength and skill against any man who looked at
me askance, an instinct which has not been taken
from me even at this day, rose up strong and I vowed
I would have some fair good exercise from this fellow,
should he not explain. Perhaps Mademoiselle—</p>

<p>Ah—there was I making mysteries again! Why
should I be forever bringing her forward into every
uncertainty. At any rate Debré, the boy, would
know. If she were among the Indians he could tell
me where. Upon his speech, then, hung all my
chance of earthly happiness.</p>

<p>Early on the morrow we went ashore and with a
ruthless disregard for the orders of De Gourgues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
I set about trying to find Olotoraca. But since dawn
he had been gone with our scouts to reconnoiter
the Spanish fort. Satouriona was at the encampment,
sending out his runners and receiving messages
from the outlying villages. He received us gravely
and took us to his lodge, lifting the deerskin at its
entrance with a grace and courtliness to excite the
envy of a gallant. He gave some orders, and when we
were seated and De Brésac asked him who were the
French people that had escaped into his hands, he
looked at us from the one to the other, saying most
frankly.</p>

<p>“We have only one, my brother, and he is but
a boy. Because of the love which we bear his
people we have kept him safe, though the Spanish
have offered us many gifts to return him to the Fort.
We love him now for himself, and have made him
one of our people. Behold, he is here!”</p>

<p>And turning, we saw a youth of sixteen or thereabouts
standing at the entrance of the lodge. For a
moment he drew back, awkward and fearful, and
would have vanished had not De Brésac called to
him in French.</p>

<p>“No. We are no Spaniards, mon cher, but those
of your own race. Come then!”</p>

<p>So great was his joy that with a cry he threw himself
upon us, clasping and patting our hands for all
the world like some dumb animal at the sight of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
master. Satouriona, cautioning us with a smile not
to do him hurt, wrapped his blanket about him and
went out of the lodge down to the beach to meet the
boat of De Gourgues, which was reported to have
left the <i>Vengeance</i>.</p>

<p>Debré was a slender lad of comely appearance;
but neither I nor Brésac remembered to have seen
him at Fort Caroline. When his first transports of
delight were over and we had told him that our object
was to destroy the Fort and to restore fugitives
such as he to their kinsmen, he looked at us in dismay,
saying of his own accord,</p>

<p>“Alas, messieurs, I am the only one who has been
spared.”</p>

<p>That was all I wished to know. I would have
arisen and gone forth from the lodge but Brésac
looked at me, laying a hand upon my arm.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said he.</p>

<p>Then said the Chevalier to the boy,</p>

<p>“You alone escaped from the Fort. Did you come
direct to the Indians of Satouriona?”</p>

<p>“I fell in with a war party of Tacatacourou.
They brought me to the chief village of Satouriona.”</p>

<p>“You saw no other persons from the Fort?”</p>

<p>“Oui, monsieur. There were several men who fled
through the swamps.”</p>

<p>“But no women?”</p>

<p>“Non, monsieur. Stay—yes, there were two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
women who fled by the casement before me and
whom I saw in the forest.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember them, Pierre?”</p>

<p>“Oui, monsieur—they were ladies who came upon
the <i>Trinity</i> with Admiral Ribault. They were noble,
I think—though I do not remember the name,—La—La——”</p>

<p>“La Notte?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the name, monsieur. I know it now,
because Mademoiselle was very beautiful, and when
we landed from the <i>Gloire</i> I asked my mother how
she was called.”</p>

<p>“And you saw them no more after that?” We
leaned forward breathlessly to get the boy’s reply.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I was wild with fear,” he said, flushing
red in shame. “My mother had been killed before
my eyes and two Spaniards had pursued me to the
breach in the wall. I fled to the forest, passing
these women in my flight. I ran on and on until I
dropped exhausted in the thicket.”</p>

<p>“You have not seen them since?”</p>

<p>“In the head village of the Indians?” he asked
wide-eyed with surprise. “No, monsieur! They
could not have been in the village of Satouriona or
I should have known.”</p>

<p>He spoke with an air of conviction which drove
away doubt from the mind.</p>

<p>But De Brésac pursued his questions undeterred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is a village called Tacatacourou, is it
not so?”</p>

<p>“Oui, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“It is possible that other French persons could
have been kept there without your knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Oui, monsieur,” said the boy wondering—“but
why should the great Paracousi, who had been so
kind, keep me away from the people of my race? I
cannot understand.”</p>

<p>“You may know in time, my good Pierre. But
there is a mystery which you may help us to solve—only
let no word of this come to the ears of the
Paracousi.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said Pierre firmly, “Satouriona is
my father and if any harm——”</p>

<p>“Ah, my child, you do not comprehend,” smiled
De Brésac. “We are friends of Satouriona and with
him we will fight the Spaniards. You must take our
word that we mean him no harm.”</p>

<p>“I will, messieurs,” replied the boy at last,
sighing.</p>

<p>“It is well, mon ami. You will have no cause
for regret,” said De Brésac. “You have been to the
village of Tacatacourou?” he continued.</p>

<p>“No, monsieur. It is a day’s journey from the
village of Satouriona.”</p>

<p>“Did you not wish to go?”</p>

<p>“Oui, monsieur, but there was no opportunity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
The Paracousi Olotoraca feared I should be captured
by the Spaniards.”</p>

<p>“Olotoraca!”</p>

<p>“Oui, monsieur. The Paracousi Olotoraca has
been a good friend and brother to me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I understand. He thought that you might
be captured again. But why should you fear capture
on such a journey? Is not the village of Tacatacourou
to the northward of this place,—away from
the fort of the Spaniards?”</p>

<p>“I do not fear, monsieur,” replied Debré with
dignity; “but if the Paracousi Olotoraca did not
wish me with him, it was not possible for me to go.”</p>

<p>“Then he did not desire you to go? That is
what I wished to learn,” said De Brésac with a smile.
Then after a pause, “Why did Olotoraca go to
the village of Tacatacourou? Is he not the nephew
of Satouriona? Is not his place by the side of his
uncle the great Paracousi?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, the Paracousi Olotoraca is a great
brave and the first young chief in all the country. He
looks about him that he may choose a squaw from
the most beautiful maidens of the nation. Therefore
he goes to Tacatacourou. This is the common
report.”</p>

<p>“Then he loves? The women there are beautiful,
Pierre?”</p>

<p>“So it is said, monsieur; though having seen none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
of them, I cannot say. Perhaps that is why he did
not wish me to go; or perhaps that is not the reason,—I
cannot say. That is all I know, and I pray that
no harm may come of the words I have spoken.”</p>

<p>“Never fear, good Pierre. You have done well.
Now if it pleases we will go forth to meet the
Chevalier de Gourgues. You will tell him what you
have told us, and as much more concerning the
armament and condition of Fort Mateo as you have
been able to learn from the Indians. Will you go
too, Killigrew, or will you await us here?”</p>

<p>“I will stay,” said I with a sigh, dropping on a
pile of skins.</p>

<p>The Chevalier looked at me sharply.</p>

<p>“Pouf! Have you no instincts—no perceptions?
You grow weary at a most purposeful time!”</p>

<p>But I did not reply. Of a truth, I was weary.
So many times had I sailed these flights of fancy to
have my poor sails torn to shreds and my poor hulk
racked bone from bone, that I was for choosing at the
last some harbor of refuge where I could find a rest
after it all. I had come with my harebrained followers
over a thousand leagues of sea,—and for what? For
murder?—for destruction?—for a vengeance by fire
and sword, as the others had? No. It was not that
which had drawn me to these God-forsaken shores—drawn
me more surely than ever plummet sought
an anchorage. It was the memory of a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
honest eyes with tear-drops trembling on the lashes,
as my lady bade me go and fight her battle for her—a
battle which by God’s grace had been deferred
until now. True, I wanted the life of De Baçan—that
was my own private affair. But what cared
I for their wars about religion? There was sin
enough in any worship which was not done in the
way of peace and good-will and I knew that we as
well as the Spaniards would all be most justly condemned
for using God’s altar to wipe our sword-blades
on. With the discovery that Mademoiselle was not
in the village of Satouriona my mind seemed to be
weakening, and I had not control over my thoughts.
The Chevalier de Brésac with his fine philosophy
had solved the matter to his satisfaction, seeing in
the actions of Olotoraca at mention of my name a
sure sign that for reasons of his own, he held
Mademoiselle de la Notte a prisoner. I could not—nay,
would not,—bring myself to believe she was
at the village of Tacatacourou. A truce to imagining!
I had gone too far, and suffered too much, to
be inventing new theories to drive me mad. We
had voyaged from one end of the earth to the other
and had come at last to the place where I had sworn
we should find her. And she was not there! That
was all. I had had enough. God forgive me! As I
lay there in my unreason, I lost all control and
cursed all things that came to my tongue, forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that it was only through God’s providence that I had
been let to live and come to this day.</p>

<p>Not caring what came of me I lay there oblivious,
until I presently heard a sound without. I raised
my head, a figure darkened the door of the lodge.
For a moment, I thought it was Pierre returning.
But a moccasined foot was thrust forward, and with
a deft and graceful movement the figure dropped
the skin at the entrance way and stepped within the
lodge. Then I saw that it was an Indian, a girl—the
most beautiful of that race I had ever seen.</p>

<p>As I lifted on my elbow I brushed my hand across
my eyes, for so quiet was she I thought truly that
this dusky vision was some creature of the fancy.
With a commanding gesture she approached. I
would have spoken; but she placed her finger
upon her lips, looking around toward the entrance
in token of secrecy. I kept my peace. At last she
uttered the one word, <em>Maheera</em> and, touching her
breast with a long slender finger, I understood that
she was telling me her name. The words, uttered
in a quiet tone, seemed to come from her throat
rather than from her lips and her voice was very low
and sweet. When she had said that, she touched
me upon my arm calling me Keel-ee-gru as though
my name were some word in the soft language
of her own. I marveled that she should know
me and could not understand what she wished. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
in a moment her object was clearer, for she began
to speak in the sign language which these strange
people have for conversing with one another when
their tongues are unfamiliar. Of this I understood
a little. She had several French words, and she
moved her lithe young arms and body with wonderful
grace, telling me by pointing to her dusty
moccasins and simulating weariness that she had
come a journey from a great distance to seek me.
I nodded my head in comprehension.</p>

<p>Then her face grew sad and her body seemed to
melt to nothingness. She clasped her right hand
upon her left and laid them both upon her heart,
saying the name of Olotoraca. So gentle, soft and
lingering was the word upon her tongue and so melancholy
her attitude, no language could have told
plainer that her heart was hers no more and that
a sadness had come upon her. She sighed deeply,
looking upon her hands and fingering her silver
bracelets. I put my fingers upon the head in pity,
for I too knew what heart wounds were.</p>

<p>But at my touch she shrunk away and her mood
changed like an April day. The look she flashed
up at me was one of pride and majesty, and there
was a spark of vengefulness, of wild unreason in it
that taught me how concealed and subtle were the
channels of her thought. She wanted no pity—none
from me at any rate. In a moment she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
gentle again, telling me that she had come from the
village of Tacatacourou and, with a gesture which I
might not mistake, that she was a princess of the
blood.</p>

<p>It was not till then, not until she had mentioned
the name of her tribe and village, that I even so
much as thought upon the object of her visit to me.
Then the suspicions of the Chevalier, the association
of the names of Olotoraca and Tacatacourou linked
her story together in my mind in some fashion. She
had come from Tacatacourou! I started up drawing
in my breath quickly and looking her in the
eyes. What if—if——?</p>

<p>She saw the note of anxious and expectant inquiry
in my look and met it with a smile and sparkling
eyes.</p>

<p>“Oui, oui,” she cried in joy. “The Moon-Princess!
The Moon-Princess!”</p>

<p>I understood. This was no mill-stone to look
through. I remembered the name Satouriona had
given to Mademoiselle at Fort Caroline. The darkest
hour of my night was past and it was dawn that
was breaking.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a><br />
<small>THE MOON-PRINCESS.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Taking Maheera by the hand and lifting her
to her feet, I pointed to the entrance of the
lodge, where the sunlight was sifting through, and
motioned her to lead on. With a friendly look
she put finger upon her lips again and peered out
across the clearing. She shook her head, and lifting
the skins at the rear of the lodge motioned me to
follow. Soon we had crept through the thicket into
the forest and went rapidly down the long aisle of
pines. At last the sounds of the Indian encampment
were merged into the voices of the wood. A bird
was singing somewhere and the sough of the wind
through the tree tops overhead somehow brought
back in a sudden flood of memory the nights at sea
when Mademoiselle and I journeyed towards this
wild western land.</p>

<p>It had all come so suddenly that I was bewildered,
as one who has been rudely awakened from a long
sleep. Truly I had been sleeping and the hideous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
pictures I had dreamed were false, De Brésac was
right after all; it was his keenness of perception
that had guessed the truth. It almost angered me
to think that my intuition, steadfast through all
these long months, should have failed me at the time
when my heart was nearest its desire; but I was too
near happiness to let any other emotion enter into
my soul.</p>

<p>I hurried on through the forest with Maheera;
who, regardless of the heat of the morning and the
roughness of the traveling, moved on beside me,
seeming not even to touch the ground and giving no
sign of fatigue. Her soft moccasins made almost
no sound among the dried branches, while I, unskilled
in wood-craft, crashed through them, awkward
and heavy-footed, raising many a bird and
beast which skurried away into the underbrush terrified
at such noisy and unaccustomed intrusion.
But for all that, it seemed to me as though my feet
bore wings and once or twice I found myself going
at so round a pace that my companion was sore put
about to keep up with me. Then, with an exclamation
at my lack of thought, I reduced my gait
and we went along more reasonably side by side.
Her mouth was set and she kept her glance before
her upon the ground. She had traversed this distance
once before, during the hours of the night, but
no complaint or sound of any kind came from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
throat. At about noon, when I wished to know the
distance of the place to which we were traveling, she
looked at the sun and pointed to the heavens, signifying
that at an hour midway between noon and
sunset we should reach our journey’s ending. Once
only did we rest. When I, feeling that the pace
must be telling upon her, stopped and pointed to a
fallen tree, she shook her head and would have gone
on had I not taken her by the hand and led her to a
seat, placing myself beside her and offering her a
mouthful of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie</i> from the flask which by some
good fortune I carried. We ate a few wild berries
and then hurried onward. We had gone what I
should have thought to be a distance of five or six
leagues when there opened out in front of us a quiet
valley with many fields of grain which cut into the
hills with squares of green and yellow. Beyond, by
the border of a river which lay like a silver snake in
the meadows, was the smoke of the village of Tacatacourou.</p>

<p>Maheera, wishing to conceal the object of our
coming, had not chosen to go straight as the eagle
flies from the encampment of Satouriona. By
taking a roundabout way we had escaped the curiosity
of the braves of Tacatacourou, who were hastening
to the great war dance and the “black-drinking”
which Satouriona had proclaimed before the attack
upon the Spaniards. Maheera, halting upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
edge of the clearing, made a sign to me and we
stopped. She motioned me to take my place behind
her, and following a thicket we moved cautiously,
encircling a plowed field in which two women were
working. Presently we passed the trees upon which
they had hung their babes, this being their custom,
and I thought we must surely have been discovered,
for the infants made sinister, wry faces when I came
close to them and seemed about to cry out. But
Maheera crept up, crooning in a low tone; and,
saying some phrases in her soft voice, held them
quiet till I had got by and was safely in the underbrush
of the forest beyond. We walked silently for
some time longer, threading the mazes of the forest,
and at last Maheera led me, trembling at the nearness
of my happiness, to an open place within a
close growth of great pine trees where several lodges,
neatly thatched and cared for, stood in an enclosure.
Then with a smile the Indian girl beckoned me on
and pointed to the entrance of the palisade.</p>

<p>I walked forward upon my tip-toes and craning
my neck here and there in a very agony of expectation.
Maheera fell noiselessly behind me, and the
crackling of every twig beneath my feet seemed to
shake me like an aspen. But we must have made
little noise, for we reached the gate of the palisade
without notice and scarce daring to breathe, I looked
around the entrance post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Mademoiselle was there! She sat upon a wooden
bench beside the door of the lodge. Her look was
turned toward the west and she did not see us as
we paused upon the threshold of the palisade. Her
hair was cast loose about her shoulders; the breeze
played wantonly with its meshes, and the slanting
sun burnished it with a golden glow like an aureole.
She was dressed, like Maheera, in deerskin; and so
pale a gem did she seem in this rough setting that her
very slenderness and fairness startled me into the
dread that she was translated, and no more a creature
of this earth. I feared to move and break the spell
that held me. But an Indian woman who sat opposite,
weaving, glanced up at this moment and espied
us; and then my mistress turned her head.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle!” I cried, coming forward, “Mademoiselle,—it
is I!”</p>

<p>She started to her feet; but casting a fleeting
glance upon me, turned half around and fell senseless
upon the ground.</p>

<p>Maheera was on her knees beside her in a moment,
and together we carried her within the lodge and laid
her upon a bed of skins and hemlock-boughs. It
was not until then that I saw how wasted she was.
I cursed myself for the boor that I was to burst upon
her so. What if, after all she had suffered, she
was to fade away like a flower under my very eyes.
It were better that she had been struck down among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the first at Fort Caroline. What if I had killed
her? The misery of that moment! I fell upon my
knees, raised my voice and prayed to God, who had
watched so long over her, that she might be spared.</p>

<p>The moments passed anxiously. Maheera forced
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-vie</i> between her lips and at last, with an intaking
of breath that racked her from head to foot,
she opened her eyes and looked to where I knelt
beside her, my anguish all unconcealed.</p>

<p>“Ah yes,” she sighed, “I remember now! It
was silly of me. I have never done so before. But
I am so weak,—so weak——”</p>

<p>Brave little heart! Undaunted and strong even in
her weakness!</p>

<p>“Nay, sweetheart. It was I who startled you.
Blame it to me. God knows, rather would I cut my
hand from my body——”</p>

<p>She laid her soft fingers upon my wrist.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she said gently, “I know. I have
learned. I know how you love me,—dear.”</p>

<p>She paused as she gained her strength, while I
mutely worshiped—then she went on reverently.</p>

<p>“It is that which neither time nor distance can
alter. It has been with me always, and so I knew
that you still lived and one day would come for
me.”</p>

<p>I had no answer but to press my lips upon her
slender wrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>She closed her eyes for a while and seemed to
sleep, while I sat beside her bed in great ferment of
mind at her suffering. But soon Maheera came into
the lodge with a bowl of some steaming herb. This
Mademoiselle drank with relish and Maheera propped
her up with robes and branches. As she grew
stronger the faint color came back into her cheeks.</p>

<p>“It is over now?” she asked at last.</p>

<p>“Yes. It is over. There shall be no more suffering.
Your friends are here and you are safe.”</p>

<p>She leaned back her head, closing her eyes and
sighing contentedly. Presently, as a thought came
to her, she started up from her pillow.</p>

<p>“Olotoraca!” she said half in alarm. “Where is
Olotoraca?”</p>

<p>I set my teeth as I thought of the haughty young
brave and his lies to me in the cabin of the <i>Vengeance</i>.</p>

<p>“You are the prisoner of Olotoraca, Mademoiselle?
If he has——”</p>

<p>“There! there! Vex me not now, Sir Firebrand.”
She smiled.</p>

<p>“But, Mademoiselle——”</p>

<p>“Nay, I am aweary. Vex me not,—there must
be no anger between you two. What! Cannot you
understand? He can be no enemy to you——”</p>

<p>“But he lied to me! He would have concealed
you and kept you from your own people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. I am his prisoner. But you must listen
to me and do what I ask of you. When you know,
you will say, it is rather a debt of gratitude than of
blood that you owe him.”</p>

<p>“Say on, dear heart, I will listen.”</p>

<p>“Then it is this.” She paused, fingering the robe.
“Olotoraca loves me, Sydney.—Nay, do not scowl so
blackly. For shame! And he but a savage creature
of the woods! Can you not understand? It is a
kind of worship. Though he comes often to this
place, he stands aloof and waits upon me as though
I were a very queen, content only to look and do
my bidding; asking for nothing and hoping for
nothing that I could not give.”</p>

<p>“But he has kept you here!”</p>

<p>“Where else could I go, good Sydney? Here
was everything this country affords. I have been
safe and cherished by his people, and this old woman
and the gentle Maheera; guarded, until last night
when they were called to the war dance, by his own
braves with never a fear of beast or Spaniard.
Sydney, it was this Paracousi who saved my life
from De Baçan, and it is he who has preserved
me against their expeditions. Presently you shall
know. Ah, you wrong him to doubt for a moment
his service or his intent. Has he not saved
me for you? No! no! no! There must be no
more blood—no more blood! But where is he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Maheera?” she inquired anxiously. “Where is
Olotoraca?”</p>

<p>“There is no need for fear,” said the girl. “Olotoraca
is at San Mateo.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I am thankful.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle gained strength rapidly. Happiness
does not often kill. And as for me, what could I
say? The mastery of my spirit was no easy task,
but as I looked at her and thought of all her suffering
there was nothing I would not have done for her.
I resolved not to wait for Olotoraca but to take her
away aboard the <i>Vengeance</i> before he returned.
Afterwards, when I learned of the battles he had
fought in her defense, upon my soul I began to have
a liking for the man, as I had at first sight of him,
in the cabin of the ship. The love we bore made
this red chief and me akin.</p>

<p>Just before sunset, my lady, having slept a little,
called Maheera to her. The Indian girl put her
dark fingers upon the fair brow, tenderly stroking
the hair away from the temples, and sighing.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle understood the easier words of the
Indian tongue and their signs, and spoke a few words
to Maheera asking her why she was sad. The red
blood of the Indian came to her face as she answered,</p>

<p>“It is that the skin of Maheera is not fair like
that of the Moon-Princess. Olotoraca looks no more
upon the maidens of his own race.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Moon-Princess will soon be gone.”</p>

<p>“It is that also which makes Maheera sigh. For
now that she has brought the White Giant to take
her away, Maheera is sorry.”</p>

<p>“It is best so, Maheera. But why did Maheera not
say that she was going to bring the White Giant?”</p>

<p>“Maheera does not know. Only late last night
came a message to Tacatacourou, saying that the
White Canoes of the French had come.”</p>

<p>“But why did she think the White Giant would
be with them?”</p>

<p>Maheera smiled.</p>

<p>“Because the Moon-Princess many times had
said that he would come—and—well—because she
wished——” Maheera was confused. She could not
acknowledge that it was jealousy. “She wished—she
wished—to please the Moon-Princess.”</p>

<p>It was my lady’s turn to flush.</p>

<p>“Ah! Maheera,” she laughed, shaking her finger.
“You must not tell of these things.”</p>

<p>The simple straightforwardness of the Indian
nature would not permit her to understand, for she
opened her eyes in wonder.</p>

<p>“Maheera thought that what she did was good.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle replied not, but I told Maheera by
signs that her heart was a heart of gold.</p>

<p>Then said my lady, “Will Maheera grieve when
the Moon-Princess is gone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not so much as Olotoraca will grieve.”</p>

<p>“But Maheera will be here and he will soon forget
the Moon-Princess.”</p>

<p>“Maheera knows not. She is sorry. She loves
Olotoraca with her whole heart but she has no hatred
for the Moon-Princess. She will think of her and
love her always—even when she has gone into the
water of the coming day.”</p>

<p>There was trembling in the soft voice of the maid.
It is a sadness to make so true a friend only to lose
her again.</p>

<p>The following morning, with many pauses, Mademoiselle
told the dreadful story of her sufferings.
Nicholas Challeux had spoken the truth. For hidden
in their hollow tree, covered by branches, Diane
and Madame lay concealed throughout the terrific
wind and rain-storm of that frightful night and
through the terror of the next day. I did not press
her to tell me more than she offered, for it grieved
her to the soul to live over again that unhappy time.
With hushed voice she told how she had fallen into
the sleep of utter exhaustion and had wakened to
find her hand clasped in the icy one of Madame,
whose wide eyes showed that she had died of fear;
she shuddered as she told of her escape upon the
second night, worn almost to death by the agony
through which she had passed; of her struggle, worn
and draggled, more dead than alive, to the river upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
whose bank she had fallen from exhaustion. Then
her face lightened a little as she told how an Indian
warrior had discovered her in the long grass and how
he had carried her stealthily to the hiding-place among
the Tacatacourous. But a Spanish soldier had seen
her, and three times Diego de Baçan had come himself
to the camps and villages of Satouriona telling
of the death of the Sieur de la Notte and of the massacres
upon the sand-spit, asking for her and offering
great rewards if they would return her to the Fort,
saying that she should be treated as a princess. Spanish
spies were always upon the track of Olotoraca;
but he, wary and skilled in woodcraft, had ever slipped
away from them,—save once, when two of them
traced him to the palisade. They had surprised
him at a time when no guards were about the enclosure.
Fearing to arouse the Tacatacourous they
would not fire their arquebuses and so set upon him
both at once with their swords. With his spear he
had pierced one through the neck. The other, taking
to flight, he lamed badly with an arrow,—so
badly that the fellow could not get back to the fort
to tell his discovery, but was killed that same night
not a league away. Could I wonder after the tale of
this service that Mademoiselle would have no blood-letting
between the Paracousi and me?</p>

<p>Then I in my turn, sick even at the memory of
it, told how the braves of Emola had found the ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
with the ancient setting and how I had given her up
for lost, and then I learned how she had given this
ring to a waiting-maid of the household of Laudonnière
in recompense for her kindness and service to
Madame. Thus all was explained.</p>

<p>That night when we had eaten, we went out into
the sweet-scented woods and seated ourselves upon
a bed of moss under a wide-spreading oak. The sun
had set and the twilight fell down upon us warm
and soft as the touch of velvet. The breeze had
blown into the west, where great banks of clouds hid
the last glorious rays of this wonderful day of ours.
For a long time we sat silent, fearing to break upon
the hush of the animate things about us. Every
twig was sleeping and over us fell that deep mysterious
spell of the giant forest which linked us with
time. For the nonce we were instincts only, symbols
of nature, apiece with eternity.</p>

<p>We were so happy that we knew how little was
the meaning of mere words. At last Mademoiselle
sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“It is the end of travail,” she said. “The world
is as tired and as content as we.”</p>

<p>“Thou art so content?” I asked, bending over
her.</p>

<p>She drew a little from me, smiling.</p>

<p>“Not too content, monsieur. Perhaps ’tis by contrast
with what has gone before.” She said it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
a touch of coquetry, that last ingredient which
goes to make a woman. For all my boorishness, I
understood.</p>

<p>“Yes, thou art happy. I can see it by thine eyes.
As for me, I will be happy when I see the roses
blooming in thy cheeks again.”</p>

<p>She made an impatient gesture. “For shame
upon such a loutish speech! Thou art not
happy!”</p>

<p>“I would say——”</p>

<p>“You would say that the roses bloom not in my
cheeks——”</p>

<p>“But, Mademoiselle——”</p>

<p>“Am I so pale, monsieur? And so uncomely?
In my life I have heard nothing so ungallant!
Think you I can find mirror and lady’s-maid in this
wild place? Monsieur—if you like me not——”</p>

<p>Scorning further parley, I had but one answer for
this protesting.</p>

<p>A little soft gray squirrel, belated, had come down
from a tree near by and sat upon his haunches,
switching his tail and looking at us most curiously.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I find you a most forward
person,” said my lady, brushing back her hair from
her temples.</p>

<p>“And I, by your leave, find you most impertinent,
and therefore quite strong enough to make a journey
with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we may get away to the ships on the morrow?”</p>

<p>“And you are willing for me to carry you.”</p>

<p>The color flushed again into her pale cheeks as
she cast down her eyes upon her deer-skin leggings
and then strove to pull the short skirt to cover over
her knees.</p>

<p>“What matters it, my Diane?” I whispered.
“And besides when the Fort is taken we may find
a minister or priest——”</p>

<p>But she clapped her hand upon my mouth and
would hear no more.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a><br />
<small>WE ADVANCE.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Before the sun had gilded again the tops of
the loftiest pines, Mademoiselle, Maheera
and I had started upon our way. I had counseled
traveling in the afternoon, but in spite of her weakness
Mademoiselle was impatient. She feared that
by some mischance Olotoraca might return. We
marched on bravely, covering two leagues before the
heat of the morning, when we made a halt that Mademoiselle
might rest. She vowed that she felt no
weariness, but after all that had befallen her, neither
Maheera nor I had the humor to see her pressed.
We knew that she would have walked on until she
had fallen from utter weariness before she would
have spoken a word of plaint. There was no need
for haste. In the depths of the woods there was little
to fear. If we reached the encampment of Satouriona
by sunset I would be well content, for Mademoiselle
could not safely be conveyed aboard the
<i>Vengeance</i> save under the cover of darkness. The
attack upon Fort San Mateo could not well be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
for two days, for Maheera made sure that not until
the war-dance and the “black-drink” were over
would her people start upon their journey to the
southward.</p>

<p>As we rested there in the deep shadows of the forest
I told Mademoiselle of Domenique de Gourgues,
and of the Chevalier de Brésac, and what they had
done for her and for me and how much I owed the
Avenger on her account and my own. When I had
finished telling her of the plans of De Gourgues, she
gave a sign of fear—the only one she ever showed.</p>

<p>“You will go!” she cried, starting up. “You
will go to the attack of Fort San Mateo?”</p>

<p>I took her hand in mine.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I said, in anguish that she should
be so troubled, “Mademoiselle! Can you not see?
My word is pledged. I must—I must go!”</p>

<p>Her hand clasped mine convulsively and she turned
her head away.</p>

<p>“I had hoped—hoped that you would not! That
you loved me more——”</p>

<p>“Do not say it, dear heart! You do not mean——”</p>

<p>“But it seems so hard! I have been so long alone—alone
and forgotten!”</p>

<p>“My Diane! Do not make it even harder for me.
Do not weaken now—you who have been so brave.”
I put my head in my hands, for I was grieving
sorely. My suffering seemed to give her strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>“No! no!” she whispered. “Forgive me. I
meant it not. I am not myself. I wish you to go.
It is a just fight. If God wills that you should have
victory, then you will come back to me safe. If you
are defeated——”</p>

<p>I raised my head with a smile.</p>

<p>“Never fear for that, dearest. There shall be no
defeat. In two days we will return—in a week will
be sailing for Merry England.” And then with a
smile, “As for me, my Diane, why I promise you
upon my word that, even if affairs go badly, I will
still return to you unscathed. I shall bear a charmed
life, and when I see that there is danger I shall stand
in the ranks of the laggards in the attack and if
there is ever a tree big enough to hide me, there
will I stay until the Fort is won.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle was laughing through her tears by
this time.</p>

<p>“Nay, that you will not,” said she proudly. “If
you go, you shall be nowhere but in the very fore
of battle.”</p>

<p>“There speaks my brave Diane! But it is impossible
we should fail. With these Indians we outnumber
them three to one; and by secrecy we will
fall upon them as they fell upon Fort Caroline, and
take them before they know that we have come.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Diane, “all will be well. We cannot
have been separated and thus brought together to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
be again ruthlessly torn apart. God has been good
to me. If there is to be further suffering—but I
cannot believe it—I will not! And now—” starting
to her feet—“En avant, Monsieur!”</p>

<p>In this way by resting often we came toward sunset
to within a short distance of the harbor and encampment.
Then, by making a wide circuit to the
left, we passed the Indian trail and by stepping-stones
crossed a small stream which ran into the
harbor. Down this we walked, I carrying Mademoiselle,
much against her will, in my strong arms,
until at the right we saw the glare of the Indian
fires upon the beach and the glimmer of lights which
showed where the <i>Vengeance</i> and the other ships lay
at anchor. When we came to another crossing
place Maheera bade us wait while she went forward
toward the encampment.</p>

<p>By this time Olotoraca must have returned from
his expedition to the Spanish Forts. I hoped that
Maheera would escape his notice, but I doubted not
that she could explain her presence at the camp to
his satisfaction. In spite of this assurance, it seemed
a long while before she came back. Several times
we heard the sound of footsteps, and thinking that
some keen-scented Indian might have wandered upon
our trail and be following it, I drew Mademoiselle
deeper into the thicket. While I feared no injury,
I knew not what complications might come should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the escape of Diane be discovered to Olotoraca. I
had disobeyed the orders of De Gourgues in following
Maheera, and I was in something of a quandary how
to have Mademoiselle conveyed aboard the <i>Vengeance</i>,
to safety. I knew that I had some stormy moments
before me with De Gourgues, but felt that could
we carry forward our object and bring Mademoiselle
aboard the vessel secretly, his displeasure would speedily
pass by; and I trusted much to Mademoiselle.
Could he resist her, he were less than a man. After
a time we heard the footsteps not of one but of two
persons, and presently Maheera’s soft voice called
out through the darkness from the crossing place
where we had been. In a moment we were together.
There was De Brésac—my good Brésac,—whom our
little guide had found at the camp. He embraced
me with great joy, saying that De Gourgues was
much perturbed over my absence, but that he himself
had believed I would return safe and sound. To
Mademoiselle he bowed with a grace which would
have done him honor at a levee, bending over and kissing
her hand and telling her in courtly phrase how long
he had looked forward to this moment. I thought
it savored too much of Paris for these rough woods,
but nothing the Chevalier de Brésac saw fit to do
was greatly out of place. Mademoiselle, for her part,
told him in her sweet voice how deep was her debt,
and the Chevalier—like all others who saw her—thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
vowed himself forever to her service. I
told him straightway that he might try his service
now, since Mademoiselle had no humor to swim to
the ship.</p>

<p>“Yes, good Sydney,” he replied, “and you have
come near enough crossing the plans of the Avenger
to set a smaller value upon your life than I have put
upon the Spanish. If I mistake not, you yourself
will need some further service from me. But I will
see. Stay here and I will return as soon as may
be.” And so he departed alone.</p>

<p>By and by the red glare of the Indian fires increased
and a murmur which at first rose no higher than the
distant booming of the surf upon the beach came
to our ears. There was a measured and rumbling
noise which I did not understand. Maheera craned
her neck and put her hands to her ears.</p>

<p>“It is the war-dance,” she said excitedly, “the dance
of the battle. Olotoraca is there. I can hear him.
They are playing upon the tawægons. To-morrow
they will drink the ‘black-drink.’ Then they will
go.”</p>

<p>In a little while the glow of the fires seemed to
light the whole firmament and the sound of the voices
and the drumming rose to a prolonged and savage
note. Louder and wilder it grew, swelling into a
vengeful and relentless scream, more animal than
human, which seemed to rend the very sky. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
dancers saw themselves already victorious at San
Mateo—and fiercely cried their desires to their gods
of war and vengeance. So piercing were the shrieks
that the beasts of the forest were aroused and we
could hear the answering howls come now and then
from the woods behind us. Even the birds started
from their perches, fluttering down past us crying
shrilly to one another in fear at the unwonted
turmoil.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle shuddered; Maheera, missing no
note of the savage chorus, said proudly,</p>

<p>“Olotoraca dances first and dances longest. Olotoraca
is a great chief!”</p>

<p>It seemed long before De Brésac returned. But
when he did, it was with the news that De Gourgues
had been placated and that a boat had come ashore
for us, down the beach.</p>

<p>“My good friend,” said he, “never in my life have
I seen a man so glad or so angry at the same time.
He walked the cabin driving his heels fiercely into
the deck. Upon my life, one would have thought
it was not you but I who had disobeyed his orders.
You might have set the whole tribe at enmity for
all the difference there would have been in his
demeanor. When I could find a pause I told him
all—Mademoiselle saved and Olotoraca in ignorance;
and he swore the harder, saying a man who obeyed
not orders had no conscience and was better dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
In his heart I think he secretly rejoices. For no
matter what the result of our venture, Mademoiselle
may stay aboard with Bourdelais, and so be safe.”</p>

<p>All of this and much more he told me as we
walked behind Mademoiselle and Maheera to the
boat, which we found upon a sandy beach at some
distance from the Indian camp.</p>

<p>In half an hour we had hooked the entering ladder
of the <i>Vengeance</i> and I breathed a sigh of relief when
Mademoiselle was over the side and safely upon
deck. De Gourgues stood by the bulwarks and
bowed low over the hand of Mademoiselle, conveying
her himself to his cabin which was brilliantly
lighted in honor of the event. But of me he took
no more notice than if I had been a lyer or a sweeper.
He requested De Brésac to go with them, and I saw
through the open door that food had been prepared.
Then the door was shut and I was left in darkness
to muse upon my indiscretions. I leaned upon the
taffrail somewhat sadly, for ’twas not a brilliant
home-coming for me. For a long time, it seemed, I
stood with Job Goddard watching the whirling shapes
at the Indian fires and listening to the savage cries
of the dancers.</p>

<p>“’Tis time them Spaniards was a-praying, Master
Sydney,” said Job; “there’s a smell o’ blood about
this here.”</p>

<p>“Aye, Job,” I replied; “I’m sick of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the cabin door flew open with a clatter
and the Chevalier de Gourgues himself came out upon
the deck shouting,</p>

<p>“Pass the word for Monsieur Killigrew.”</p>

<p>I walked out of the darkness and stood before him
in the glare.</p>

<p>“I have come aboard, sir,” I said, doffing my
cap.</p>

<p>“My eyes are reasonably good, monsieur,” said he
most sharply and coldly, looking up at me like
a game-cock for some moments. “Nor have I a
custom of any incertitude of mind. But Saprelotte!—I
am of two dispositions about you!”</p>

<p>He leaned forward scowling and I was much disconcerted.
“You have placed all my plans in jeopardy
and I know not whether ’twere best to hang
you to the main yard or to blow you to perdition
with a powder charge. But”—his rigidness fell
away from him and he broke into a merry laugh—“you
could not wait? Eh, my beef-eater? Par
la Pâque-Dieu. I blame you not—I blame you for
nothing! Not if you had disobeyed the orders of
the Admiral himself.”</p>

<p>He took me by the arm and led me into the cabin,
where Mademoiselle, tired but content, was smiling
at us.</p>

<p>“The lady pleads your cause well, monsieur,” said
De Gourgues. “She has my service. This time I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
forgive you. But remember,” he laughed, “if it
happens that you disobey <em>her</em>”—and he paused—“if
you disobey <em>her</em>, there will be no spar upon the
<i>Vengeance</i> high enough to bear your bones!”</p>

<p>By midnight the sound of the mad revelry upon
the shore had ceased, and in the silence of a night
which held a deeper content for me than I had ever
known, I fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>The following day was consumed in the final preparations
for the attack and in the drinking of the
“black-drink” by the Indians. It is a custom with
them before they go into battle or danger of any
kind to drink as much of this concoction, which is
the brew of a kind of leaf, as they can hold. They
believe that it purifies them from all sin, leaves them
in a state of perfect innocence, and inspires them with
an invincible prowess in war. De Gourgues, in order
to show how strong were his prowess and sympathies,
pretended to swallow the stuff; but he afterward
told me that when he found the opportunity he had
poured a quantity of it out upon the ground. It was
evening before the Indians gathered their weapons
and filed off into the forest, it being agreed that the
French should go by water and meet them before
the attack. De Gourgues had no further need to
encourage his men. The excitement was at fever
heat; and aroused to the very bursting point of
enthusiasm, they tumbled down into the boats with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
ready weapons and purpose that could know no
turning. François Bourdelais, with twenty sailors,
was left upon the ships. In the event of failure he
was to wait as long as might be for the men to return
and then set sail for France. Mademoiselle was safe
at any rate. I was glad that she did not appear
upon the deck. It would have savored too much of
that day when I had left her upon the bastion at
Fort Caroline. But among the excited Frenchmen
there were many embracings and many messages to
wives and mistresses. After that, they went blithely
enough. For it was a wonderful venture on which
we were going. We were about to attack four hundred
hardy, well-trained men, in a stone fort where
with reasonable skill they might hold their own
against an army.</p>

<p>We were well under way before the darkness
swallowed up the dim shadows of the ships. Hour
after hour of that calm, half-tropic night we pulled
at our oars, gliding softly along by the sombre
shores, sliding now and then over a pebbly bar,
but moving ever slowly on to the southward, with
the soothing murmur of the surf in our ears, and
the balsam of the land breeze in our nostrils. In
the gray of the dawn we came to another river and
a breeze sprang up from the sea, which, by sunrise,
blew with violence from the north-east. Here we
found our Indians waiting upon the bank. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
while the gale delayed us, but our Frenchmen would
not wait long, rowing at last boldly across. Had it
not been for the morions with which they were
forced to bale incessantly, they must surely have
sunk. As it was, the boat in which I was conveyed
with De Gourgues was half full of water when we
arrived upon the beach.</p>

<p>When we had landed and put ourselves to rights,
led by the Avenger, we pushed forward on foot
through the forest. By the side of the Captain
marched Olotoraca armed with bow and arrows and a
French pike to which he had taken a great liking.
Looks of friendliness passed between us. I doubted
if they had been so friendly,—at least upon his part,—had
he known. The arquebusiers followed, while De
Brésac and I with our armed seamen brought up the
rear. All of that day until five of the afternoon,
pausing only to eat and drink, we hewed our way
through the swamps and thickets toward our destination.
Then almost spent by hunger and fatigue
we came to another river, or inlet of the sea which
Dariol—interpreting for Olotoraca—said was not far
from the nearest of the Spanish forts at the mouth
of the river.</p>

<p>Job Goddard, footsore and weary, brightened at
the gleam of the water.</p>

<p>“’Odds ’ounds! Master Sydney, ’tis a mighty
sweet sight. Do we take to the boats again now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
sir? For my legs have little energy enough. Unless
I may sit down to my work, ’tis a bad fight I’ll make
this day for poor Salvation Smith, sir.”</p>

<p>When we had crossed the river in the canoes which
had been sent, we found three hundred Indians
waiting for us. But tired as he was De Gourgues
would not rest. With Olotoraca and ten arquebusiers
he set out to reconnoiter, for he wished to
attack at daybreak. While we rested, night closed
in, and finding it vain to struggle on in the darkness
among the tangled vines and fallen trees,
De Gourgues was forced to return to us anxious
and gloomy. After he had eaten something, a brave
of the Chief Olotoraca came to him saying that he
knew of a path along the margin of the sea. De
Gourgues joyfully set us all in motion again.</p>

<p>The brief rest had made new men of us, and even
Job Goddard caught some of the spirit of the adventure.
The path being a good one we went forward
with speed; and at dawn, after a night of indomitable
perseverance upon the part of these soldiers, we
reached the banks of a small stream. Beyond this
and very near was the first of the smaller forts that
had saluted the <i>Vengeance</i> as we sailed up the coast.
But to our great chagrin we discovered that the tide
was in, and having no boats at this point we could
not cross. De Gourgues was in a great ferment of
mind, for he had hoped to take the fort while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
defenders slept. He walked nervously up and down
the bank trying in vain to find a fording-place. To
add to the discomforts, a drenching rain fell upon us
and the arquebusiers had much ado to keep their
gun-matches alight. But they held them under
morions, thus preserving them and screening the
glow from the sentries of the Spaniards. The light
grew fast, and so we withdrew to the shelter of the
thicket. The fort was now plainly to be seen and
the defenses seemed slight and unfinished. We could
even mark the Spaniards within, yawning and stretching
their arms as they crawled lazily from their
beds at the call of day. It was maddening to the
Frenchmen. I could see them crouching all around
me, their eyes glowing like the sparks of their
match-cords, and their hands trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>After a time, which seemed interminable, the tide
went down; or at least it fell so low that the stream
would not come higher than the arm-pits. And,
finding a spot concealed by trees from the view of
the fort, the passage of this stream was begun.
Each man tied his powder-flask to his morion, held
his arquebuse above his head with one hand and
grasped his sword with the other. The channel was
a bed of sharp-pointed shell-fish, and the edges of them
cut the feet like knives even through our boots.
The Frenchmen rushed through the water unmindful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of all save the eagerness to be within the Spanish
fort. But as they came out from the stream, lacerated
and bleeding from the briars and the shells, the
Avenger restrained them and set them in array of
battle under cover of the trees, where they stood
panting, their eyes kindling and their hearts throbbing
in a frenzy of anticipation. Now that his quarry
was in plain sight, De Gourgues laid his plans with
the deliberation of a careful field-captain, sure of his
position and of his men, but waiting only to devise
the more surely. Whatever happened at Fort San
Mateo, he was sure of these two forts at least.</p>

<p>When the men were all in line and had looked
carefully to their weapons, he drew his sword so
fiercely that it rang against the scabbard. He pointed
it through the trees.</p>

<p>“Look! my comrades!” he cried, “there are the
robbers who have stolen this land from our King;
there are the murderers who have butchered our
countrymen!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a><br />
<small>THE DEATH OF THE WOLF.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">De Gourgues gave the word. Cazenove
with thirty men pushed forward to the Fort
gate while the main body of us under De Gourgues
ran at full speed for the glacis. We were not discovered
until we were well up the slope, when a cannoneer
who had come upon the rampart sent up a startled
cry.</p>

<p>“To arms! To arms! The French are coming!
The French are coming!”</p>

<p>The Spaniards had just finished their morning meal
and came rushing up, fastening on their steel-pieces.
The gunner who had given the alarm, hastily aiming
his cannon at us, fired wildly and the ball went
crashing into the thicket. He had time even to load
and fire again before Olotoraca, who had outstripped
the others, ran up the glacis, leaped the unfinished
ditch and drove his pike through the Spaniard from
breast to back, pinning him to the gun-carriage.
Some of the Frenchmen were by his side in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
moment, and jumping down into the fort they cut
their way into the thick of the superior numbers, who
fell back before the fierce onslaught.</p>

<p>“After me,” shouted Cazenove from the gate.
“They fly by this way. At their throats, mes garçons,
cut them down!” De Gourgues turned the
rest of his men in that direction. The Spaniards
were caught between two fires and all of those who
had escaped from the Fort were imprisoned between
our party and that of Cazenove. The Indians too
came thrusting upon their flanks. Many of them
fought desperately, but their efforts were futile
against the whirlwind of passion of the Frenchmen
who beat them to the earth like chaff. All except
a few were killed upon the spot. Those who were
spared were saved by the Avenger for a more inglorious
end.</p>

<p>During all this time we had been aware that the
Spaniards in the fort upon the other shore had taken
alarm and were firing upon us without ceasing. But
when the first victory had been won De Gourgues
turned four of the captured cannon against them;
and to such good purpose that one of the Spanish
guns ceased firing at once, the men running below
in dismay. Then one of the boats, a very large
barge which by this time had arrived along-shore,
was brought to the landing-place and eighty of us
were crowded into it. The river here is about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
quarter of a league in width, but the Indians rushed
into the water after us and holding their bows and
arrows above their heads, swam across straight as
water-rats. Their dark faces, fierce and scarlet-streaked,
seemed to darken the whole surface of the
water and inspired a great fear in the Spanish
garrison. Whichever way the Spanish looked, there
was certitude of a horrible death before them, and so,
seized by a sudden panic, they fled terrified to the
woods. But by this time we had landed below them
and blocked their path with the arquebusiers, sending
charge after charge into their ranks and cutting them
down without mercy. They recoiled again in dismay,
but the Indians had crawled dripping upon the beach
and were upon them with savage shouts, beating
them down before we could come within sword-thrust.
It was with difficulty that De Gourgues
could save the lives of a few; and indeed he had no
notion of sparing them altogether. He only saved
them—as he had saved the others—for another
death.</p>

<p>I did not know De Gourgues in the character of
blood-letter. He had lost that cheeriness and buoyancy
that had drawn me so closely to him. Upon
his face he wore a look of satisfaction that was a
horror to see. For, vengeance done, a man with any
shred of compassion in him must now and then give
vent to some expression to show that his devil craves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
a compromise with his God. But not so, De Gourgues.
He looked at the blood about him without
pity or compunction, and cast upon those who had
been taken so sour a look that some of them drew
shuddering to the length of their bonds away from
him. Even I, accustomed as I had become to the
horrors of carnage, turned away in disgust, for the
sights I saw among the Indians were too savage for
description, and the French were little better. Job
Goddard was everywhere in the thickest of the fighting.
And though he had little pity for the Spaniards,
he, like myself, shrank from cutting down disarmed
men. Once I saw a fellow whom he had
spared rise upon an elbow and with his last remnant
of strength send his poniard flying at my Englishman.
It hit Job fairly in the upper arm and stuck
there quivering. Goddard nonchalantly plucked it
out and put it in his belt saying,</p>

<p>“A good line shot, me friend, but most indifferent
elevation. When ye wish to strike home, <em>aim high</em>
me garlic eater, <em>aim high</em>! An’ ’tis no cursed bad
advice for a man about stepping across the threshold
of eternity!”</p>

<p>As for me, all this slaughter turned my stomach
and I sat apart, for I had come out for no such business
as this; I wanted the butchery speedily over,
and the attack on San Mateo made immediately.
Should we be successful there, I knew that other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
such scenes would be witnessed, for De Gourgues had
vowed there should be no shadow of difference between
the massacres of Fort Caroline and Fort San
Mateo. But in spite of repugnance at what would follow
I hoped and prayed that we might be victorious.
For I felt again the same old passion to be
at the throat of De Baçan. I made my vow that
he should die only through a fair test of skill or
strength with me. How I might save him from
those red hell-hounds, our allies, I did not know,
but if I could compass it, I intended to meet him
upon even terms. My practise in Pompée’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle
d’armes</i> should have made my sword-play good
enough to cross blades with him. I scarce know
why this haunting desire to fight De Baçan should
have filled me so relentlessly through all these
months; and now since Mademoiselle had not fallen
into his hands, I—not he—had won the game, and
the ancient grudge was fitter upon his side of the
balance than upon mine.</p>

<p>But De Gourgues had deferred the attack upon
San Mateo until his preparations could be carefully
finished. All the next day we spent in making ladders
to scale the walls; sending orders through
Satouriona and Olotoraca to the Indians, giving
them their stations in the forest and arranging that
no movement should be made until a signal was
given. So closely had Satouriona and Tacatacourou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
watched the Fort, that, though making no attack
and keeping well in the shadows of the forest, they
had succeeded in confining all the Spaniards within
their own lines. Those gentry heard the savage
cries resounding through the woods until their echoes
faded away in the distance. There was desperate
work before them and they knew that the sounds of
the war-cries and the barking of the French arquebuses
down the river meant a harder fight than they
had ever had before. They judged from the sound
of the shots that the French numbered several thousand.
All of this we learned from a Spanish soldier
who ventured out, feathered and painted like an Indian.
He came within the lines of our outposts, but
the lynx-eyed Olotoraca, walking with De Gourgues,
spied through his disguise and the man was seized
before he could get away. From him the Avenger
learned that in Fort San Mateo were two hundred
and sixty Spaniards under Don Diego de Baçan.
This confirmed the report we had heard. De Baçan
was still there. I feared at this last moment of my
quest that some unhappy accident might have sent
him on an errand to San Augustin.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day after the first
assault, De Gourgues, well pleased and confident that
his plans were carefully laid, gave orders that the Indians
should close in upon the fort with all possible
secrecy and lie in wait under the shadows of the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
and bushes of the hills and river bank. Before the
day had broken we were in marching order and after
a hearty meal went up the stream in glittering ranks,
joyful but steady and assured of victory. De Gourgues
made no concealment of our movements, and
when we came in view of the Fort we saw the battlements
shining with men in armor and knew that
De Baçan was prepared to receive us. Presently,
when within range of their ordnance they opened
fire with their culverins from a projecting bastion.
De Gourgues broke our column and scattered us
through the woods, where their fire had little
effect; for here the forest was very thick and overgrown
and afforded a most excellent cover. We
marched to the left, passing through our Indian
allies, who lay like snakes among the undergrowth.
We came at last to the top of a small hill, from
which we had a good view of the whole extent of
the defenses of Fort San Mateo. It was plain to be
seen that these had been greatly improved since its
capture from Laudonnière.</p>

<p>De Baçan apparently had by this time lost all trace
of our whereabouts. Thinking we had defiled by
the river bank, in a moment he sent a strong party
of Spaniards to reconnoitre. They came from their
works, crossing the ditch and, all unconscious, made
straight for the clump of woods in which we lay ensconced.
De Gourgues, noting the advantage of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
position, quickly detached Cazenove with a party to
station himself at a point well hidden by trees where
he could soon take them in the flank. The Spaniards,
unaware that they were exposing themselves
to this enfilading fire, with a strange insistence
which seemed not unlike infatuation, continued
sturdily to advance.</p>

<p>Now it was that the discipline of the arquebusiers
of De Gourgues showed to greatest advantage. He
had cautioned them under pain of dire punishment
not to fire before the word of command. In their
ardor they strained forward eagerly, leaning upon
their rests, their eyes glancing down their weapons,
their fingers toying lovingly with their match cords.
But not until the Spaniards had come so near that
we could plainly make out their features did the
Avenger give the order to fire.</p>

<p>Then a deadly blaze flashed in their faces, almost
close enough to burn them. The shock was terrific;
and before its echoes had rumbled up the river we
were upon them through the smoke, slashing and
piercing right and left those who stood their ground,
driving those who ran, in dire confusion, back toward
the Fort. But here Cazenove awaited them and
poured in a scorching fire at easy range which still
further cut them down. None escaped. The pikemen
of Cazenove charged over them again and again
like demons, and those few who were left threw down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
their weapons and fell upon their knees extending
their arms and begging for mercy.</p>

<p>The fight was speedily over, with no loss to us.
When we had mounted the hill again, it was easy to
see that consternation reigned in the Fort. Soldiers
ran here and there upon the battlements shouting in
confusion; while men, women and children, uttering
piercing screams, rushed to the gate, battering upon
it with their bare fists, trying to force their way out
that they might escape to the forest.</p>

<p>The trumpet of Dariol, sounding the charge, rang
out clear above the din. Never before, it seemed to
me, had a battle-blast been sent up so loud and exultant.
It was the signal of De Gourgues. Through
thicket and scrub, down the hill for the Fort, we
ran, a very human mounthsoun, shouting like madmen.
Every stump and tree to the right and left of
us seemed to turn by some magic into a painted
savage and the air was filled with their wild screams.
De Gourgues, Olotoraca and I reached the gate at
the same moment, followed closely by the more
speedy of the rest. By this time the women and
children were running through the postern, screaming,
to the forest. Their fate I like not to think
of.</p>

<p>We were after more sturdy game. Most of the
soldiers had fled even before the women, but we saw
forty or fifty Spanish arquebusiers formed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
square by the corps-de-garde for a last resistance. I
knew I should find De Baçan there. Nor was I
mistaken; I saw him at the same moment that he
caught sight of me, and we ran forward upon each
other with the same full-hearted hatred that had ever
envenomed us. The world was too small a place for
both.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the affair were to be ended
one way or the other then and there. But as luck
would have it, Olotoraca, being more swift of foot,
reached him first and began thrusting with his pike.
De Baçan was thus put upon his guard against the
Indian and had all that he could do to parry his
furious onslaught. Twice his guard lay open and I
might have thrust him clear through the body, but I
could not bring myself to take such advantage. A
nimble fellow rushed at me and all but caught me
off my guard, giving me trouble for some minutes.
He was a most excellent swordsman and fought with
desperation. But he tired easily, and while I played
upon the defensive, I watched De Baçan and Olotoraca
out of the tail of my eye. By this time the
sword of the Spaniard was hissing backward and forward
like the tongue of a serpent along the pike of
Olotoraca. The Indian had not the skill of a seasoned
pikeman and only made up for his lack of
knowledge of the art by his great suppleness and
agility. Suddenly I saw him lunge too far. I beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the blade of my fellow down and let him go his way,
while I made for De Baçan. The Spaniard seized
the pike-handle just behind the head and pulled the
young brave forward, thrusting at the same time, I
made a leap, hoping to parry the thrust of the Spaniard,
and partly succeeded, but the sword point
passed through the body of the Paracousi so that he
fell back upon the ground.</p>

<p>Men were fighting all around us, but by some
chance we were quite alone in the shadow of the
Corps-de-garde.</p>

<p>“You might have killed me,” he panted—glancing
this way and that,—“why did you not?”</p>

<p>“We are quits then. But it is not too late, Señor
de Baçan. On guard!”</p>

<p>Still looking furtively around, he made no motion
to raise his bloody point from the ground, but kept
edging away.</p>

<p>“Quick, sir! On guard!” I cried, “or I will run
you through!”</p>

<p>He made a sudden leap backward and vanished
quickly around the corner of the building, passing
several Frenchmen, and in the confusion reached the
battlements before I could stop him, and with a
laugh sprang out into space. Without so much as
looking, I leaped after him into the mud and water
of the river bank. I landed fair up to my knees
and fell over in the water. For a moment I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
my legs had been driven into my body, but managed
to get to my feet in time to see my enemy rushing
for the thicket. In a second I was after him and
plunged through the bushes guided by the gleam of
his morion. All around us were shouts of French
and Indians and once we passed a half-score red
men who were dancing around a poor wretch tied to
a tree. They saw us go by and let fly a shower of
arrows at both, thinking that I too was an escaping
Spaniard. But they did not follow us; they were
enjoying too horrid a pleasure to leave. We ran
thus for some distance, when, reaching a level space
of ground, De Baçan stopped suddenly, awaiting my
coming. He leaned with both hands upon his blade,
breathing heavily. His face was purple from exertion
and the sweat poured from his forehead down
his cheeks and into his beard. I was hard put myself
for breath and came forward cautiously.</p>

<p>“Again! Señor Pirato,” he sneered, with a kind
of a laugh.</p>

<p>“For the last time,—Señor Spaniard!” I said approaching.</p>

<p>“For the last time? Ah! then you do grant I
am the better skilled at sword-play?”</p>

<p>“Let us settle the matter at once,” said I, bringing
my point into line.</p>

<p>“One moment!” he said craftily. “When I kill
you, what will become of Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw his object. He sought to unsteady my
nerves. But I only laughed at him.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is in the hands of her friends,
Señor.—Come now! Enough! You have your wind.
Fall to, or I will run you through!”</p>

<p>I threw off my morion to keep my brow cool.
And while in the very act of tossing it aside he
leaped for me, engaging with such incomparable
swiftness that I broke ground and gave back ten—twenty
paces—under his fierce assault. I held my
own with great trouble. But he saw no sign of it,
upon my face and it is my pride that I ever looked
coldly in his eyes, fearless and confident. Once he
grazed my arm and with flashing eye sprang forward
to follow his advantage; but I met him with so
shrewd a guard and thrust that he drew back, looking
at me in surprise. We heard indistinctly the cries
of the soldiers and the Indians at the fort, and now
and then a wild yell would start the echoes in the
forest near us. But we fought on, our eyes looking
into each other’s, glittering and more piercing even
than the swords we wielded. Shouting was now
most plainly to be heard in the direction from which
we had come. I heard Job Goddard’s whistle and a
cheery cry.</p>

<p>“Keep him at work, sir! we are with you in a
minute!” Diego’s eyes looked over my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Unless you hurry, Don Diego,” I said, coolly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
bantering him, “there will be little time for
this exhibition of sword-play you have promised
me.”</p>

<p>I knew could I get him angry that I might have
the better advantage.</p>

<p>“Bah!” he cried, furious. “Coward! you cannot
fight your battles for yourself!”</p>

<p>“I am holding my own!” I smiled.</p>

<p>I know not just why it was, but strive as he might,
he could get no advantage. I have no memory of
ever having used my sword so well. <a href="#image04">Quick as he
was, my hand was ever quicker</a> and my eye seemed
by the look of his own to divine his thrust before he
made it. The sounds of the voices grew louder and
louder each moment and seemed to be near the edge
of the wood. The look in the eyes of De Baçan
became uncertain. He had tried upon me every
feint and thrust he knew, and there I still stood
before him smiling and confident. It was not fear
that he felt, for I believe the man feared nothing on
earth—or above it—or below. It was an expression
rather of wonder and curiosity as if at the last he saw
in me the image of vengeance come to bring him, in
spite of his prowess, the retribution he so amply
deserved. Twice he had had me in his power, my
death hanging by a web so fine that he could have
blasted it by the breath from his lips,—and still I
lived.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="image04" id="image04">
<img src="images/image04.jpg" width="600" height="383" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_357">“<span class="smcap">Quick as he was, my hand was ever quicker.</span>”</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>All of this I saw in his look. I smiled at him
again, and that infuriated him the more. Scorning
all thought of defense, he crouched his head and
came for me desperately—his feints and thrusts were
quicker than thought itself, and my eye, bewildered,
could no longer follow the motions. He caught the
point of my blade near the hilt of his own, and with
a quick back stroke of the wrist sent it flying down,
the handle almost out of my fingers. I clutched it
again, bringing it up to the guard. But he had
sprung in and thrust me through the thigh. At this
moment there was an outcry upon our left, and
De Brésac, with some of my seamen, came running
forward.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Sir Pirato!” laughed De Baçan. “I
have no time to finish this——” and turning, he
made for the opposite side of the clearing.</p>

<p>I shouted at the top of my lungs and made a leap
after him, but fell prone to the earth. He made for
a hole in the thicket, and I thought must surely go
free.</p>

<p>But while I looked, a number of dusky figures
sprang up all around him, and I saw them leap upon
him like hounds upon a stag. He threw his arms
out wildly, and one of the savages who bounded into
the air, was skewered upon his sword, while another
fell away from him into the bushes as though he had
been tossed by an ox. The Spaniard was making a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
wonderful fight, but the Indians, infuriated by the
fall of Olotoraca, went rushing fiercely forward
crying that he should not escape. One of them
pinioned his left arm to his body, and hung with
a death-like clutch around his legs. Before Satouriona
reached them, another, more successful than
the others, sprang upon the back of De Baçan, and,
brushing off his morion, struck again and again upon
the bare head with his hatchet. When the hollow
dulness of the strokes fell upon my ear, I knew that
the end had come. He swayed back and forth a
moment, striving to keep his feet, unwilling to relinquish
his hold upon life, fighting even when death
had come; then, with a groan like that of some
hunted animal, turned half around and sank to the
ground, dead where he had stood.</p>

<p>When he had fallen the savages fell upon the
prostrate body like wolves, tearing at the clothing,
and would have beaten him with their war clubs as
he lay, had not De Brésac and Satouriona come up.
I cried out to them that it was the Commandante
of the Fort whom they had killed. De Brésac was
among them, striking with the flat of his sword, and
crying:</p>

<p>“Stop! you dogs! Away with you! Stop! I
say!” He stood over the body with his drawn
sword while they glowered at him, and would have
struck him down had not Satouriona come between.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
At last the Paracousi, with a few words, sent them
away, their gruesome fancies ungratified.</p>

<p>It was a dog’s death for so valiant a man—pulled
down like some wild beast of the forest. When I had
been carried to where the body lay, De Brésac and
I vowed he should have a decent burial. I hated
him, and hate him now. But it was a passion made
great by the intensity of it, and I could not bear
that the majesty of his prowess should be dimmed by
any ignominy at his death. De Brésac, fearing to
bury him in the knowledge of the Indians, gave
orders to the seamen that he should be taken to
Fort San Mateo. When I had bound up my leg,
thither we presently repaired, I leaning upon the
arms of Job Goddard and Brésac.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a><br />
<small>AND LAST.</small></h2>


<p class="cap">And so it was all over. The mission of De
Gourgues was ended. However bloody the
retribution he had wrought upon his enemies, France
was avenged. I was thankful that my flight into
the woods had spared me much of the butchery
at Fort San Mateo; what we saw in the forest was
horrible enough, and though by the time we returned
the Fort had been cleared, a dreadful climax
to this grim tragedy was being enacted.</p>

<p>As we entered the postern gate we saw De Gourgues
standing,—menacing, sinister and pitiless,—before
the ranks of trembling, haggard wretches who
had been spared from the massacre. They were not
many; and the slenderness of their number was
a dire augury of the punishment which was to be
theirs. They did not know what was to come. They
scanned the merciless man who stood before them,
seeking to find in the lines of his face one trace of
sorrow or pity. But the eyes where pity might have
been were set and fixed; hard as the lines of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
nose and mouth. The brows had lost their melancholy
and were drawn into a tangle and snarl of
wrinkles, which took away every vestige of the man
I knew and loved. He returned their look with a
glance from which they cowered as though he had
struck them; a glance that meant but one thing, and
that was—the end. A few of them stood upright
and fearless; others fell down upon their knees,
whimpering. The end—Holy Virgin! What end?
What death? When the Avenger spoke, his voice
was dry and hard as flint.</p>

<p>“Did you think,” he said, “that so vile a treachery,
so detestable a cruelty, against a King so potent
and a nation so fearless, would go unpunished?
Hell knows no viler traitor than your master,
Menendez de Avilés, of whom you are but the
spawn! No! I am only one of the humblest of the
subjects of my King, but I have charged myself with
avenging the deeds of this Menendez—and yours—against
my hapless countrymen. There is no name
base enough to brand your actions, no punishment
sharp enough to requite them. But though you
cannot suffer as you deserve, you shall suffer all that
an enemy can honorably inflict, that your example
may teach others to observe the peace and alliance
between our Kings which you have so perfidiously
violated.”</p>

<p>Then he waved his hand, and the wretches were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
marched out through the gate down to the river.
Some of them cried aloud that they would not go.
Others clasped the knees of the French arquebusiers,
sobbing out like women in their degradation that they
had helped to hang the Frenchmen of Fort Caroline,
that they had confessed and hoped for mercy.
These were rudely dragged to their feet and prodded
with pikes until they followed the others, trembling
in an agony of fear. When they had come to a
place near the river, the Indians pointed out to De
Gourgues the trees upon which the Frenchmen of
Fort Caroline had hung. De Brésac and I knew them
well. And upon these same trees without other
speech or ceremony, the Spaniards were hanged.</p>

<p>After it was over, De Gourgues caused tablets of
pine to be nailed over their heads where all men
might read. Upon these tablets were inscriptions
burned with a hot iron which read:—</p>

<p class="noic">“<span class="smcap">Not as to Spaniards,<br />
But as to Traitors, Robbers and<br />
Murderers.</span>”</p>

<p>His vengeance was complete.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night, when it was dark, De Brésac, Job
Goddard and another, buried De Baçan deep in a
sand-dune. Indian messengers were sent to the
river of Tacatacourou to bring the <i>Vengeance</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
others’ vessels into the River of May. But at dawn
the following morning we saw them passing the
forts at the river’s mouth and we knew that the
anxiety of François Bourdelais had got the better of
him. When those on the vessels saw the standards
of France waving upon the battlements of the lower
forts, their cannon boomed forth a joyous salute
which was answered there and at San Mateo.
Before noon they anchored near the Fort and I was
carried aboard to Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>I could not suffer her to go ashore while traces of
the slaughter were in such ghastly evidence. For
there were sights to cloud and torment throughout
all recollection a mind innocent of the indecencies
of life. Already the vultures were wheeling high
over the forest and I prayed that the business which
still kept the Avenger would soon be concluded.
We were sick of the place, and Mademoiselle and I
had no desire to go upon the shore.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Maheera came aboard. Unable
to stay at the Tacatacourou River while these great
events were going forward, she had followed us and
lain in concealment since the attack. To Mademoiselle
she brought a message from Olotoraca, who was
at the Indian encampment—not dead, but very sorely
wounded from the thrust De Baçan had given him—and
who wished Mademoiselle to go to him.</p>

<p>I would have deterred her, for I knew not what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
design he might cherish. Maheera understood me,
but she smiled as she had not smiled since I had seen
her.</p>

<p>“The White Giant has no need to fear. Olotoraca
knows all, and it is well. He has a great friendship
for the White Giant.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle started up.</p>

<p>“I must go, Sydney. There will be no harm,
and if he wishes me I cannot leave this land without
seeing him. Maheera would not give me bad
counsel.”</p>

<p>“The Moon-Princess will take no hurt.”</p>

<p>I could not be satisfied to have her out of my
sight, but asked Cazenove to take some men and go
with her. They were gone a long time, and when
they returned Mademoiselle was smiling and tranquil.
Olotoraca was very weak, but would recover.
He said that I, the White Giant, had parried the
blow which had wounded him and so had saved his
life. He wished to live fair in the memory of the
White Giant,—he was glad that the Moon-Princess
was safe with me.</p>

<p>“It is not well,” he had said at last, taking Maheera’s
hand in his, “that a man should love at all
unless of the people of his own race.”</p>

<p>Had I been able to go to him I would have
clasped him heartily by the hand. But they told me
I must lie quiet for fear of setting loose an artery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and so I stayed on my pallet fanned by the cool
breezes of the sea and blessed by the sight of Diane,
who sat near at hand with beaming eyes, ministering
to me.</p>

<p>The capture of the Spanish Fort had in one way
been a great godsend to her. For in the quarters
of the women, De Brésac had found a box full of
linen and silks and a few things even that had been
brought to Florida by Mademoiselle herself. These
the Chevalier sent to her with a gracious word as her
share of the spoils. The silks were of no very recent
fashion to be sure, but all the gold and silver in
the world could not have contributed so much as
these to Mademoiselle’s content. Nor were they of
any particular kind of shape, hanging about her
slender figure like lean biscuit-bags. But with ready
grace and wit she made shift to fasten and tuck
them, so that after all they were none so bad as
they might have been. She was so sweet and graceful
a sight to my eyes that I feared should I close
them I would lose not only the vision but the reality,
and find myself again upon the sand-spit,—at Paris,—or
in the forest,—seeking her ever with new hopes
which were born only to be blasted again and again.</p>

<p>At last I slept; and the morning sun was breaking
across the narrow cabin as I wakened. When I
had eaten, I felt so strong and well that I would
have risen, but Diane pressed me quietly by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
shoulders and would not permit it. After awhile,
when all was ready, my pallet was carried up on the
after-castle, in the shadow of an awning, where I lay
with several others and watched the fellows upon
the shore. They were busy as bees and I felt a lazy
dolt to be lying there twiddling my thumbs.</p>

<p>Two or three times the unruly and riotous spirit,
engendered by shedding of blood, broke forth among
the Frenchmen; but so complete was the control and
discipline which De Gourgues had put upon them
that little harm was done. Once they had broken
into a wine cask without his knowledge, and there
was like to be a repetition of the affair of Cabouche.
It is a strange thing that Cabouche himself, who had
often made good his boast of bully of the fore-castle,
should have been the one to put this small mutiny
down. For he stood in the doorway of the wine
room pointing his arquebuse toward his companions
and vowing he would shoot the one who advanced.
It was said, when it was done and they had retreated,
that he disappeared into the darkness and took a
good paunch-full himself, coming forth with a strong
smell of alcohol hanging about him.</p>

<p>In the afternoon there was a wonderful scene. De
Gourgues gathered all the Indians about him under
the battlements and, through Dariol, made them a
long speech. From time to time they uttered loud
cries which broke in upon his words. When he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
done, a prolonged yell came from the savages and
they swarmed over the ill-fated Fort, looking not unlike
a swarm of ants upon a hill of their own. They
rushed through the living quarters and the barracks
and out upon the roofs tearing and rending until it
seemed as though some movement of the earth or
elements were splitting the buildings to pieces. In
two hours the corps-de-garde was razed to the ground.
Meanwhile a great number had mounted the battlements
and with pikes, pieces of iron, and any rough
implements that came to hand, began prying the
stones from their places. With savage cries of exultation
they tossed these out into the river or
threw them in the ditch or thicket. A dust arose
which hid them from our sight, but they worked on,
as though maddened, in the heat and glare until sundown,
when not one stone was left upon another.
It was a whirlwind of ruin.</p>

<p>That night when I heard the preparations above
me for sailing on the morrow, it seemed impossible
that only a week and three days had passed since we
had come to anchor in the Tacatacourou—since we
had made our league—found Mademoiselle—passed
the hardships of the march and attack, and come to the
successful ending of our expedition. De Gourgues
said little. When he had finished speaking to the Indians
he had come aboard and set all the seamen to
work stowing the vessel and breaking out the spars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
and sails for the voyage. That night Mademoiselle
and Maheera bade a tearful good-by, for they had
come to love each other with a fond affection; and
to this day I cannot forget the services the Indian
maiden did for me and mine. On the morrow the
anchors were broken out, and with a favoring breeze
we moved slowly down the river toward the sea;
while the Indians, shouting messages of good will to
us, ran along the banks until the freshening wind had
driven us from their sight.</p>

<p>When the ships passed the smaller forts I could
see that there too the work of destruction had been
complete; for the stones and fascines were scattered
in all directions, and only a few overturned and broken
gun rests showed where the bastions had been.
We sailed out over the bar at high tide and with a
last salute to our friendly hosts we set our prow
squarely abreast the broad surges, for France. In
a few days I could almost crawl about the decks
without an arm to steady me. In two weeks I went
about some simple duties; and in the long summer
twilights, Mademoiselle and I would sit high up on
the slanting after-castle near the lanthorns, looking
back down the pink, swirling wake toward the land
where we had both suffered so much. Of De Baçan
we spoke but once. I let fall a word of regret that
so gallant and splendid a fighter should have been of
so ill-favored a disposition. But Mademoiselle made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
me no reply. With the thought how near she had
come to falling into his hands after the capture of
Fort Caroline, she shuddered, drew closer to me and
would hear of him no more. We had too many
present joys to conjure up the miseries that were
past. We had been born into a new world of our
own and we peopled it with fancies as blithe as ourselves.
Under the laughing stars we were creatures
of unreality, unconscious of all save the great love
which had conquered everything. De Gourgues sat
with us sometimes, but not for long; for there is no
pain keener than that which comes from seeing a
forbidden joy through the eyes of another.</p>

<p>My tale is soon ended. We reached Rochelle
after a voyage of little event, and were greeted with
great honor. So soon as it could be accomplished,—and
that was with such speed of habit and frock
making as was never known before or since,—Diane
and I were married. The endurance and strength of
heart which bore her up in all her sufferings among
those wild western forests has, to this day of our age
and contentment, been my sturdiest prop in time of
stress. I need not tell at length how, through
Coligny, the prize money for the <i>San Cristobal</i> was
turned over at last to Captain Hooper; and how
upon a certain successful voyage from Plymouth I
came to be his second in command, nor how I owned
my own vessel before my mistress had Domenique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and little Diane well out of their swaddling clothes.
The Chevalier de Brésac has come back from his
voyage with Sir Walter Raleigh. M. de Teligny
is dead, leaving the Chevalier a great fortune, and he
is now out upon a venture of his own. Job Goddard,
hoary headed and staunch, but convincing and windy-worded
as ever, sits smoking at his window in the
Pelican with Martin Cockrem. And the two
rogues, gathering the growing youth of the docks
about them, with easy elaboration, tell wonderful
yarns of voyages to strange countries where people
walk upside down, and of a preference use their toes
for fingers, to which the urchins listen, their wide
mouths agape and their eyes agog with curiosity.
Job has set about planting a patch of tobacco at
Plymouth; but his pursuit has fared ill, and so he
gets the leaf in bales from the ships that come laden
to Plymouth from the western main.</p>

<p>It is history how De Gourgues was spurned at
Paris by that weakling, Charles; how our own good
Queen Bess of England offered him a command, and
how Charles thereupon relented, and would have
given him a position of authority. But De Gourgues
was never a stranger to adversity; and through it
all, his great grief has ever been that Menendez de
Avilés escaped the vengeance at San Mateo, of which
he had been the dearest object. This malefactor
died full of honor and riches, high in the favor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
Philip of Spain, who, had he lived, would have given
him command of the great Armada.</p>

<p>That Spanish fleet, so long threatened, has come and
gone. Through the good offices of Sir Francis Drake
and Lord Howard, for both of whom my father had
performed some service, I was given considerable responsibility
and command upon Drake’s own <i>Revenge</i>,
acquitting myself to the great Admiral’s satisfaction.
So that I came into the royal service again as commander
of the <i>White Bear</i>, and gained for myself many
emoluments and honors. By great good fortune I
thus won my way into the notice of the Queen, and
so, through her generosity, was enabled in some sort
to restore my family to the prestige it had enjoyed before
the imprudences and generosities of my grandfather
and father had depleted the value of the estates.
I lay no claim to credit for these achievements. Had
it not been for Diane, I should have made no attempt
to regain the position of my family before the Court.
Her soft influences, strong and womanly, have weaned
me away from the boisterous habits of my wild
young life, and have shown me the value of the
refinements which come of gentle living: With the
death of the Queen Mother, in France, there came, too,
a change in the fortunes of Diane and the great
Henry—the greatest, Henry of Navarre,—with that
rare grace which has ever distinguished him, has given
back again the estate of La Notte, at Villeneuve, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
my wife. Thither, at certain seasons, we go; forming
thus another link, not without a certain value,
between two great Christian monarchs.</p>

<p>Diane has built a summer-house on her estate, and
she has fashioned it after the lodge of Olotoraca,
where during those long months she waited for me.
It is not in a wild pine forest, where every night the
winds may sing their grand and lonely psalms. It is
on the borders of a quiet lake, where soft sweeping willows
whisper with the rippling water, and tall poplars,
like sentinels, guard us against the legions of unrest.
When the sun has set, and the slender moon has
sailed out across the deep green vault above us, then
we sit, hand-in-hand, dreaming and at peace, I—and
Mademoiselle.</p>
